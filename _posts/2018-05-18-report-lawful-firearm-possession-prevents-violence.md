Possession of firearms by law-abiding citizens reduces crime and is key to deterring gun violence, a newly released report says.

The Patriot's Guide to Freedom and Firearms, published by The Heartland Institute, which publishes Budget & Tax News, includes fact-based solutions for reducing gun violence without infringing on people's constitutional rights.

**Dangerous defenselessness**

John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, says the Heartland report is correct to note banning firearms does not prevent criminals from committing violence.

"Gun-free zones are worse than not working; they serve as a magnet for attacks," Lott said. "Criminals, generally --- and mass public shooters, specifically --- try to pick targets where people are defenseless. Ninety -seven percent of the mass public shootings from 1950 to today have taken place in gun-free zones."

**'Very tempting' to killers**

Joyce Malcolm, the Patrick Henry Professor of Constitutional Law and the Second Amendment at the George Mason University School of Law, says those intending to commit mass violence find gun-free zones to be extremely attractive targets.

"Gun-free zones don't work because they're an invitation to anyone who wants to commit mayhem," Malcolm said. "The last thing they want is to be confronted with someone with a firearm who can fire back. A gun-free zone is very tempting. That's the unfortunate part.

"I'm sure they're well-intentioned, but they advertise that the people inside are going to be vulnerable," Malcolm said. "Almost all of these mass murders have occurred in gun-free zones."
