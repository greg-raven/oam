- Original title: "More misleading information from Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety on guns: 'Analysis of Recent Mass Shootings,' Showing how mass public shootings keep occurring in gun-free zones" Originally posted on September 9, 2014.

We have since updated our information up through May 30, 2018.
