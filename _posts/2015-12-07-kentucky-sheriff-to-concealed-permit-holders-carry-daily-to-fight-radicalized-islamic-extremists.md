Sheriff Helmig posted this call to duty to Facebook, where he wrote:

> On January 16, 2013, I released a letter that outlined my commitment to the Second Amendment and Solemn Oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. In the wake of the recent tragedy in San Bernardino, California carried out by Radicalized Islamic Extremists and Terrorists, I continue to stand committed to the safety and security of our community; however I can't do it alone.


He then referenced Sheriff Paul J. Van Blarcum of Ulster County, New York, who has urged concealed permit holders in his county to carry for the purpose of self-defense and stopping attacks post-San Bernardino.

Helmig continued:

> I have reminded my current and retired Deputy Sheriffs of their responsibility to carry their firearms while off-duty. I would also like to remind the people who have applied, been trained, and issued a license to carry a Concealed Deadly Weapon (CCDW) that they also have a responsibility to carry their firearm, which they are proficient with, for the safety of themselves and others. It is also the responsibility of everyone to refresh themselves with the laws that govern the privilege and great responsibility that accompany being a CCDW license holder.

[...]

He closed his call for armed citizens by writing, "Each of us, as proud Kentuckians, has a great responsibility to uphold the values of the United States Constitution and protect this great nation from acts of foreign or domestic terrorism. 'United We Stand, Divided We Fall.'"

In addition to Sheriffs Helmig and Blarcum, Brevard County Florida Sheriff Wayne Ivey has also called for concealed permit holders to carry daily in the wake of terrorism.

Fox 13 News reported Ivey saying, "Let there there be no mistake ... The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. If you're a person who is legally licensed to carry a firearm, now is the time more than ever to realize that you, and you alone, may very well be the first line of defense for you and your family."
