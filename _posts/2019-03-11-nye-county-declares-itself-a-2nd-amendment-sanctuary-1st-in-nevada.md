Today, Commissioners passed a resolution declaring Nye County a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary and calling on Gov Sisolak to "veto any legislation which infringes on the right of the people to keep and bear arms."

Now 15 out of 17 counties are currently planning to vote on similar resolutions. Next Week on Monday, Lincoln County is taking up a similar resolution. The Democrat led Majority in the Nevada State legislature is currently considering more gun laws including so called Red Flag Laws, so called assault weapons bans and magazine limits. With 15 of 17 counties now expected to declare themselves 2nd Amendment sanctuary, a constitutional crisis is percolating for Governor Sisolak along with a show down with rural sheriffs and law makers.
