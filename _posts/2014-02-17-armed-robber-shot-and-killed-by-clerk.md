This is the second story we've reported this month in which a suspected armed robber armed with a stun gun was shot and killed by his would-be victim.

According to My San Antonio, a man armed with a stun gun tried to rob an area convenience store. The clerk, who was armed with a firearm, opened fire on the suspect and struck him.

The suspect was declared dead at the scene.

According to My San Antonio,

> Garvelli said the man, between 25 and 30, was armed with a Taser when he tried to rob the store. A clerk pulled out a handgun and fired multiple shots, police said, but it was unclear how many times the man was hit.

This is the 144th defensive gun use we've documented in the state of Texas and the 1,068th defensive gun use we've documented overall. Texas continues to lead all other states in the number of defensive gun uses we've been able to document.
