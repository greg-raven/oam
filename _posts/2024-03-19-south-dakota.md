Yesterday, Governor Noem signed Senate Bill 203, legislation that would allow individuals with enhanced concealed carry permits and with permission from the school principal, to carry on public school grounds. Additionally, on March 5th, the governor signed House Bill 1228, which will allow hunters to wear fluorescent pink as an alternative to orange, providing them with additional choices in the field. The NRA would like to thank Governor Kristi Noem and members of the South Dakota legislature for their continued support of our Second Amendment rights and hunting heritage.

SB 203 amends current law, by allowing an individual with an enhanced concealed carry permit and written permission from a school principal or individual with control of supervision of the grounds, to carry at a public primary or secondary school. This bill recognizes the ongoing effort to protect our most vulnerable by securing our schools.

HB 1228 will allow sportsmen and women to wear fluorescent pink as an alternative to hunter orange, providing additional choices in the field while maintaining the spirit of the law.
