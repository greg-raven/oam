Gov. Glenn Youngkin wasn't exactly the most forthcoming when asked about his pro-gun credentials. While he was undoubtedly better than the Democrat he was running against, there were concerns that he wasn't as staunch a Second Amendment proponent as many would have preferred.

That wasn't helped by his evasive answers about whether he'd sign gun control that was worming its way through the state legislature earlier this year, either.

In the end, though, he vetoed those bills.

In fact, Youngkin has been a solid bet for Virginia gun rights activists.

> Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed 30 gun control bills on Tuesday afternoon, using his perch as a Republican governor to restrain Democrats from taking the state in a leftward direction despite the party having taken full control of the legislature in November.
>
> “I swore an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of Virginia, and that absolutely includes protecting the right of law-abiding Virginians to keep and bear arms,” Youngkin said in a statement.

[...]

All in all, he knocked down every anti-gun bill sent to him, gave the legislature a reason, and some of them aren't really reasons they can work around. His arguments are solidly pro-gun and while there are suggestions he's open to compromise, I don't actually see any of that here and now.

[...]

All of these bills were trainwrecks in and of themselves. If all of them had been signed, it would have changed the landscape of Virginia in ways that would propel it into the ranks of among the most anti-gun states in the nation.

It wouldn't quite be New York or California, but it would have been close enough for folks living there.

Thanks to Youngkin, it's not happening.

Elections have consequences, and sometimes those consequences get to happen to the other side.
