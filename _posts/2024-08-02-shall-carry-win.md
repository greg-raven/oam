Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) announced today that United States District Court Judge George L. Russell, III has issued a decision declaring Maryland's bans on firearm carry in locations selling alcohol, private buildings, or property without the owner's consent, and within 1,000 feet of public demonstrations unconstitutional in its federal Second Amendment lawsuit Novotny v. Moore. The opinion can be found at firearmspolicy.org/novotny.

"We are pleased the court blocked some of Maryland's unconstitutional restrictions on the right to carry firearms in public," said FPC President Brandon Combs. "But we have more work to do and are committed to finishing the job. FPC and our allies will continue to fight forward until all peaceable people can fully exercise their right to bear arms in Maryland and throughout the United States."

Novotny v. Moore was consolidated with Kipke v. Moore. FPC offers its thanks and congratulations to all plaintiffs in the consolidated cases, including its partners Maryland Shall Issue, Inc., Second Amendment Foundation, and Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc.

This challenge was brought as part of the high-impact FPC Law strategic litigation program to eliminate disarmament regimes and restore the natural right to keep and bear arms.
