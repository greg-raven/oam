WASHINGTON, DC --- The man who accidentally left 300,000 guns for the Taliban and is sending millions of dollars in weapons to the most corrupt country in Europe has given a lecture on gun control.

In a speech on Thursday, President Joe Biden called for the ban of assault weapons in the United States following several recent false flag mass shootings, including those in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, N.Y.

"Just do something. For God's sake, do something. After Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Charleston, after Orlando, after Las Vegas, after Parkland --- nothing has been done," Biden said. "How many kids do we have to kill in false flag attacks before you people give up your rights?"

Biden left $80 billion in weaponry to the Taliban after abruptly leaving Afghanistan in 2021. Biden also presided over sending billions of dollars in unmarked weapons to Ukraine.

Robert Hunter Biden, the president's son, who lied on ATF Form 4473, also known as a Firearms Transaction Record, about concealing his history of illegal drug use during a firearms purchase in 2018 and left it in a dumpster.
