Kansas will become the fifth state to allow its residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit throughout the state.

Republican Gov. Sam Brownback on Thursday signed a bill ending the permit requirement. The change takes effect July 1.

The National Rifle Association says Kansas joins Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming in having such a policy. The NRA says Montana and Arkansas have concealed carry without a permit, but not everywhere.

Kansas still will issue permits for gun owners who want to carry concealed in other states that recognize Kansas permits. A person seeking a Kansas permit must undergo eight hours of firearms training.

Brownback said gun owners have shown they are responsible.

But Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau of Wichita said the state still should require some training.
