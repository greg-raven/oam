Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden's proposed gun control policy includes a provision that could require every AR-15 rifle be registered under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Unless there were some form of carve-out, this could mandate that American gun owners pay a $200 federal tax per AR-15 that they own.

The National Rifle Association's Andrew Arulanandam told Breitbart News that the current "low end" estimate of privately-owned AR-15s in the United States is 18 million. A tax of $200 on 18 million AR-15s means that gun owners could potentially be required to a pay a collective $3.6 billion in taxes, if this policy were enacted into legislation.

That figure does not even consider other guns that might be deemed "assault weapons" by Democrats, which could also fall under the same provisions of the National Firearms Act, Breitbart reported.

In addition to the $200 tax, owners of guns that are deemed "assault weapons," under Biden's view of the NFA, could also be required to register these weapons with federal authorities, submit their finger prints and photograph, and potentially submit to an FBI background check.

All of this is detailed on Biden's campaign website.

As noted, this policy could encompass "all existing assault weapons." In practice, this could mean every American who owns a weapon like an AR-15 --- or any other gun deemed by Democrats to be an "assault weapon" --- could be required to submit their fingerprints and photograph, undergo an FBI background check, register these weapons with the ATF, and pay the federal government a $200 tax for each weapon.

In a recent interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper asked Biden, "So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they're going to come for guns?" Biden responded, "Bingo. You're right, if you have an 'assault weapon.' The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period."
