Washington, D.C. --- U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) today introduced the Firearms Manufacturers and Dealers Protection Act of 2015, legislation to protect the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, and firearms and ammunition manufacturers by terminating Operation Choke Point.

Operation Choke Point was formed as a partnership between the Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and gave Attorney General Eric Holder the means to cripple firearms and ammunition manufacturers through regulatory pressure on the financial institutions they do business with. While the FDIC has claimed that it will cease its targeting of firearms manufacturers under Operation Choke Point, evidence has shown that firearms vendors are still being targeted by regulations.

"Operation Choke Point is an attempt by the Obama Administration to weaken 2nd Amendment rights in America, which enable people to protect themselves and their families," said Rubio. "We must stop this administration's effort to target private industries and the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens."

Rubio's legislation would entirely defund any activities associated with Operation Choke Point and forbid the U.S. Attorney General from restarting a similar program under another name.

This legislation is endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Gun Owners of America (GOA).
