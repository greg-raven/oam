Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has successfully blocked video from a controversial talk he gave at the Aspen Institute last week from being posted online.

At the Institute's Feb. 5 event, the pro-gun control multi-billionaire suggested keeping guns out of the hands of young, male minorities.

Ninety-five percent of murders are attributed to the group, said Bloomberg, who has spend tens of millions of dollars on various gun control initiatives, including the group Everytown for Gun Safety.

[...]

During his talk, Bloomberg also discussed "stop-and-frisk," a policing practice he advocated and expanded during his mayoral tenure. He said that one way to deal with the issue of gun proliferation among young, minority males is to "throw them up against the wall and frisk them."

Bloomberg's comments prompted a response from the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association.

"Mayor Bloomberg's statement that black males should not be allowed to have guns echos similar sentiments made by southern white supremacists in the 19th century," Tom King, the association's president, said in a statement, according to the Washington Times. "So-called 'Black Codes' were enacted by various southern states to discriminate against black Americans and maintain the system of white supremacy that made slavery possible. These included restrictions on firearms possession."

"If a politician said this about anything other than guns, the mainstream media would be all over them," King added. "Michael Bloomberg isn't just any politician, he is the leading voice for gun control in America. He should be held accountable for this slander."

Webmaster comment: Even a blind pig finds a truffle once in awhile. Bloomberg is wrong almost all of the time, so it's ironic that he's being criticized for speaking the truth ... finally.
