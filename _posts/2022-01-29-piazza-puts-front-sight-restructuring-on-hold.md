Dr. Piazza, creator, owner, and figurehead of the Front Sight firearms training facility in Pahrump, NV, today announced that the mandatory emergency 'restructuring' of fees for members and course attendees he announced on January 23 has been put on hold. Somehow, the dire need for cash flow that existed a week ago has evaporated. Piazza claims that this is possible because so many Front Sight members stepped up, grateful to be able to spend even more money supporting Front Sight than they had up to this point.

Piazza calls those who have opted in to his latest fleecing scheme Gold Status members, but others have more cynically referred to them as Golden Suckers or Golden Geese.
