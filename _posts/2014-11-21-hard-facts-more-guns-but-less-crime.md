Jeff Knox looks at recent stats that belie controllers' anti-firearm rhetoric

\[...\]

Proponents of gun control have been highly successful at keeping American's attention focused on a leaf or two in the huge forest of reality. They point to declining violent crime rates as proof that people who choose to carry guns for self-defense are paranoid and in the next breath raise alarms about the threats posed by aberrant deviants gaining access to firearms.

It's high time the American people --- and the politicians we hire to act in our interest --- stop focusing on leaves or single trees and step back to look at the whole forest.

Here are the numbers that really matter from the FBI's recently released 2013 Uniform Crime Report:

1. Murder involving firearms has plummeted to a new "normal" that is 39 percent lower than it was in 1997.
2. Violent crime involving firearms has been steadily going down during that same period --- by about 65 percent --- and has yet to plateau.
3. Unintentional deaths involving firearms have been going down steadily since 1930 and are currently at an all-time low.
4. The number of guns in circulation, the number of gun owners, the number of households with guns in them and the number of people licensed or otherwise able to lawfully carry firearms for personal defense in public are all at all-time highs.

These are all clear, irrefutable facts. They are not nuanced by collection methods or skewed by someone's personal bias. Some might claim that some of the numbers are over- or under-estimated or reported, or that points chosen for comparison or inclusion create some distortion of the total perception, but there can be no doubt that there are millions more guns in circulation today than at any time in our nation's history, and the rate of gun ownership today is sharply higher than it was a few years or a few decades ago. Simultaneously, "gun murder," "gun violence" and unintentional "gun deaths" have not gone up, but have actually declined.

Are more guns in private hands driving crime and accident rates down? I don't know. What I do know is that the growing number of guns in private hands is not driving crime and accident rates up. That is absolutely clear from this raw data, and anyone who suggests otherwise is prevaricating.
