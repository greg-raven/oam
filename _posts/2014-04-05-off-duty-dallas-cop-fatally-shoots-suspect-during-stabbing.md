An off-duty Dallas cop fatally shot a man who was stabbing another individual at a downtown business Friday morning.

According to local media, Vincent Cortez, 45, was at work around 9:30 a.m. when he discovered a man trespassing on the company's fenced-in property. Cortez then asked the man to leave and he and a female employee began to escort the intruder off of the property. But as they were leaving, the man pulled out a knife and began stabbing Cortez. The female employee starting screaming for help and called 911.

Meanwhile, Sgt. Jackie Moore had just parked her car at a nearby parking lot. She was off-duty at the time, but on her way to a second job working security at the Final Four. Moore heard the woman's screams and immediately came to their aid.

The officer witnessed the suspect stabbing Cortez and instructed him to drop his weapon. Yet instead of complying, the man, still armed with a knife, then moved towards Moore instead. At that point, fearing for her own safety as well as the two employees, Moore fired several shots, striking the suspect multiple times.

The suspect, later identified as 26-year-old Codi Bullard, was pronounced dead at the scene. There are unconfirmed reports that he was homeless and had previously served in the military.

Authorities believe that Bullard was attempting to steal items from the demolition company.

Moore and the female employee were not injured during the incident.
