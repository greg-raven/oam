- Madera County Board of Supervisors approved the sanctuary resolution Tuesday morning in a 4-0-1 vote, making Madera a Second Amendment Sanctuary.

- The resolution affirms support for gun ownership rights and calls for opposition to unconstitutional firearm laws.

- The move responds to California's new AB 1127 law, which limits the sale of easily modified firearms, including some Glock models.

The Madera County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to declare the county a Second Amendment Sanctuary in a 4-0-1 decision, with Supervisor David Macaulay abstaining.

The resolution, introduced by Supervisor Jordan Wamhoff, expresses the county's support for the right to keep and bear arms and its opposition to any law viewed as an unconstitutional restriction on that right. The measure passed without any amendments.

Supervisors Wamhoff, David Rogers, Robert Poythress, and Leticia Gonzalez voted in favor of the declaration. Robert Macaulay did not state a reason for his abstention.

The vote comes in response to recent state legislation. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1127 earlier this month, banning the sale of firearms that can be readily converted into fully automatic weapons. While the bill does not name specific brands, its language effectively restricts the sale of certain Glock models in California.

The Madera resolution states that the Second Amendment is a "fundamental" right and affirms support for responsible firearm ownership. It also calls on the Madera County Sheriff's Office to continue processing concealed carry permit applications in a timely manner and to ensure free training remains available for eligible residents.

Although largely symbolic, the resolution aligns Madera County with other jurisdictions nationwide that have adopted similar sanctuary declarations to oppose state or federal gun control efforts.
