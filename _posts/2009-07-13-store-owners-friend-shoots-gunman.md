A man entered the Golden Market in Richmond, VA, with his revolver out, told everyone to get on the floor, and then walked over to the store's owner and shot him twice without provocation. The shooter then moved over to a teenager and raised his gun to shoot him when another customer pulled out his concealed weapon and fired. The bad guy ran to the back of the store and found another innocent man lying prone and attempted to shoot him, until the hero distracted him and shot at him again.

The bad guy walked around the store attempting to execute people and each time the hero shot at him and forced him from his murderous intentions. Finally the bad guy walked in between aisles and the hero took his shot unfortunately learning that his single action revolver's trigger spring had snapped and therefore the trigger would not return forward. Not missing a beat the hero simply fanned the hammer like in old school westerns striking the bad guy twice and ending the attack. The store owner survived and the bad guy was killed. No other injuries occurred thanks to a law abiding citizen being armed and present.

**Two shot in South Richmond store**

By Reed Williams, Richmond Times-Dispatch

A gunman who had wounded a shopkeeper and opened fire on several customers was stopped yesterday when another man shot him at the store in South Richmond, authorities said.

The violent attempted robbery took place shortly after 1 p.m. at the Golden Food Market at 2701 Jefferson Davis Highway, the same store where another man was shot last month --- and only three blocks from the scene of another robbery in June that left a shopkeeper dead.

[...]

"Whoever did it probably saved their lives in there," [Reva] Trammell said of the shooter.

[...]

The man who shot the robber is a friend of the store owner, and he was wearing a holster with a Western-style revolver, said Managing Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Tracy Thorne-Begland.

After the suspect shot the store owner and opened fire on patrons, the owner's friend shot the suspect once in the torso, took his gun and called police, Thorne-Begland said.

[...]

Police said they expect to file charges against the suspect.

The store owner's injuries did not appear life-threatening, authorities said, but the gunman's injuries were said to be life-threatening. No one else was hurt.
