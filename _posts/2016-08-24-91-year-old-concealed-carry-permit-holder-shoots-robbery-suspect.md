According to The Detroit News, around 10:15 a.m. in Detroit, Michigan, the 91-year-old man parked and exited his car. He was "heading into the Rite Aid on Gratiot near Nine Mile" when a man with "erratic" behavior confronted him. The elderly men issued numerous warnings that he was armed and would shoot, but the man continued with the robbery attempt.

Sergeant Martin Campbell says the suspect then "pointed an unknown object at the victim," and the 91-year-old man opened fire, striking the suspect in the neck.

The suspect fled across Gratiot but was located and arrested. He remained hospitalized throughout the day Monday.

On December 1, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Detroit Police Chief James Craig stressed the importance of an armed citizenry. He encouraged law-abiding citizens to acquire concealed permits and carry guns for self-defense. In January 2014, Craig had said that "good community members who have concealed weapons permits" deter crime and save lives.
