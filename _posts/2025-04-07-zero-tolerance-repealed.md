- Major second amendment win for the Trump Administration

Washington, D.C. --- In a significant win for the Second Amendment, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) announced today the repeal of the controversial Federal Firearms Administrative Action Policy, also known as the Zero Tolerance Policy. First introduced under the Biden administration, the policy aggressively targeted gun dealers for minor paperwork errors—creating fear and uncertainty across the firearms community.

The decision to roll back this anti-gun policy comes under the direction of the Trump administration and marks a key step toward restoring Americans' access to firearms. The DOJ and ATF, now led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Acting ATF and FBI Director Kash Patel, will also begin formal reviews of the tyrannical stabilizing brace rule and the unlawful "engaged in the business" rule used to target private gun sellers.

The stabilizing brace rule, which attempted to reclassify braced pistols as short-barreled rifles under the National Firearms Act, and the "engaged in the business" rule, which was a backdoor attempt to create Universal Background Checks, were both the subject of national backlash and multiple court challenges.

Gun Owners of America has long sounded the alarm on the weaponization of the ATF under the Biden administration, where bureaucratic overreach was used to harass law-abiding gun dealers and crush small businesses. The so-called "Zero Tolerance" Policy wasn't about safety—it was about control. GOA and Gun Owners Foundation responded with force, filing two major federal lawsuits: Kiloton Tactical v. ATF and Morehouse Enterprises, LLC v. ATF (II). Today's repeal is a direct result of sustained legal and grassroots pressure --- and a clear sign that this administration is serious about restoring constitutional order.

Erich Pratt, Senior Vice President of Gun Owners of America, issued the following statement:

"For years, the Zero Tolerance Policy has been a tool of political retribution—targeting gun stores and Americans who were simply trying to exercise their rights. We applaud President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and Director Kash Patel for listening to gun owners and taking action to repeal this abusive policy. This is what pro-gun leadership looks like."

Aidan Johnston, Director of Federal Affairs for Gun Owners of America, issued the following statement:

"Under President Trump's leadership, we're seeing a realignment toward the Constitution. This repeal and regulatory review of ATF's "Zero Tolerance" Policy sends a clear message that the era of Biden gun control is over. GOA is grateful for the administration's commitment to restoring Second Amendment rights and standing with law-abiding gun owners nationwide."
