ORRVILLE, Ala. (AP) --- Dallas County sheriffs say a man accused of trying to rob a dollar store in Orrville at gunpoint was fatally shot by a customer.

Sheriff Harris Huffman told the Selma Times-Journal that Kevin McLaughlin, of Dallas County, came into the store carrying a gun and led a group of people into the store's break room.

Authorities say while McLaughlin was giving orders, a customer pulled his gun and fired a single shot, killing the man.
