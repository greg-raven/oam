- Tell Congress to fix and pass H.R. 38!

Gun owners need --- and deserve --- strong protection of our right to bear arms!

President Trump has already expressed support for strong nationwide carry laws. But unless Congress passes strong legislation to enact desperately needed nationwide protections for the right to bear arms, gun owners like you will not be able to lawfully carry for self-defense throughout the United States.

H.R. 38, the "Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act," is a well-intentioned bill but has serious legal flaws that must be fixed. That's why we are working to rally gun owners across the U.S.A. --- to fix and pass H.R. 38 NOW!

Proud American gun owners must demand that Congress send President Trump a carry bill that actually works. Learn how to do that --- [then TAKE ACTION to fix and pass H.R. 38](https://www.firearmspolicy.org/hr38#civiclick-widget-container) --- right here!

When you take action, you will be automatically entered to win a SIG P226 XFIVE Legion with a Romeo 1 Pro valued at over $2,500!
