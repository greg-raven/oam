Rough transcript:

"The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common."

Stop. Stop.

We need to remember that the mainstream media orchestrates these stories if you're seeing negativity towards firearms in the news right now that thought process was planned up months and years ago we're heading into an election cycle and we're going to continue to see negative things that they want to push policy on we got to stay too true to ourselves and make sure that we take our priorities to the ballot box in the next year.
