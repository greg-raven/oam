Dark Storm Industries LLC, a federally-licensed firearms manufacturer currently located in New York, will relocate to Titusville, FL and expand its advanced manufacturing facility. The project is expected to create 50 new jobs with an average annual salary of $50,000 and a capital investment of approximately $3.2 million. Products manufactured by the company are shipped across the United States.

The facility is expected to create an additional 20 indirect jobs and 17 induced jobs. The combined net new annual wages from all jobs are estimated to be more than $4.4 million with a contribution to GDP greater than $9.6 million, and a 10-year economic impact in excess of $95 million. The selected site is located at 2000 Shepard Drive, Titusville, FL 32780.

"The City of Titusville is extremely excited to welcome Dark Storm to our city. I am confident they will be proud to call the 'Gateway to Nature and Space' their hometown," said Titusville Mayor Dan Diesel. "I am grateful for all the hard work of the Economic Development Commission of Florida's Space Coast, the North Brevard Economic Development Zone and our city staff. We look forward to assisting Dark Storm with their relocation and new manufacturing facility. Again, welcome to Titusville!"
