The argument in favor of arbitrarily revoking the Second Amendment rights of college students, as is done in dozens of states, has ostensibly been rooted in safety concerns.

And it just got a lot weaker.

Two anti-gun professors wrote in the Washington Post that "campus-carry laws will invite tragedies on college campuses, not end them." Another liberal professor, writing for the New York Times, warned that "when there are more guns around, there is more risk --- it's as simple as that."

The trouble with such predictions is that they tend to be tested as time goes by. And as it turns out, they simply weren't true. Students just aren't waging the gun battles that anti-gun activists expected. A new report from the College Fix looked into this narrative, and it came up empty.

When a reporter reached out to numerous universities that permit campus carry, "all of the schools that responded confirmed that they have seen no uptick in violence since their respective policies were put in place." Responding colleges included Emporia State University, Dixie State University, and Valdosta State University. Separately, the Texas Tribune has reported that after the Lone Star State implemented campus carry at four-year colleges state-wide, it resulted in "no sharp increase in violence or intimidation," and in fact, the following year was "quiet" and "uneventful."

These are just a few examples, but even studies cited favorably by gun control advocates admit that "results certainly do not prove that campus carry causes more crime." Essentially, it's now clear that conservatives and libertarians had this one right. Allowing American adults aged 18 to 22 to exercise their Second Amendment rights on public college campuses is a no-brainer, as there are few rights more fundamental than the right to self-defense. Plus, the inconsistent nature of current "gun-free campus" rules already makes little sense.

The current system in many states bans college students from carrying guns but would allow adults of the same age who do not attend college to carry firearms. This is an arbitrary inconsistency that makes little sense, as there's nothing to suggest that college students are more violent or less responsible than their noncollege peers. So, too, guns are often allowed at high-risk off-campus sites such as fraternity houses, yet barred from the actual campus --- a glaring inconsistency that makes little sense. And now it's officially confirmed that arbitrarily revoking college students' Second Amendment rights doesn't even make anyone safer.

It's impossible for blue-state legislators and liberal college administrators to keep justifying their harsh anti-gun policies. That is, unless they're willing to admit that they just hate the idea of gun rights.
