An 18-year-old man learned the hard way that in Chicago, you never know who's carrying. After carjacking a man, robbing two women at gunpoint, and attempting a third armed robbery, the would-be criminal ran out of luck --- and into a concealed carry permit holder who was ready to defend himself.

According to Colion Noir, the suspect's short-lived crime spree ended in Westtown when he tried to rob a 36-year-old man who was unloading his car near Artesian Avenue. But this wasn't your average victim --- he was armed and trained.

The suspect had allegedly stolen a 2025 Toyota Corolla earlier that afternoon on Chicago's West Side, then used it to pull up alongside two 27-year-old women and rob them at gunpoint, taking their phones, wallets, and purses.

Just five minutes later, he made his final and fatal mistake.

When he approached his third target --- another man he thought would be an easy score --- he found himself outgunned. The concealed carrier drew his firearm and shot the attacker multiple times in the chest and head.

Police recovered the stolen property inside the Corolla, along with the weapon the suspect had used.

In a viral breakdown of the incident, Colion Noir didn't hold back. "This dude steals a car, robs two women, and then tries to rob a third person --- only to get lit up like a Christmas tree," Noir said.

"You've got to be either bold or dumb as hell to try a three-person robbery spree in a city where concealed carry is legal and think you're just gonna walk away clean," he said.

Noir highlighted that this wasn't some teenager playing around. "He was 18. A legal adult who apparently decided the streets were a better option than Call of Duty," he added.

The incident took place just 18 minutes after the carjacking. Noir noted the suspect's spree lasted under 20 minutes before he was gunned down.

"This is exactly why concealed carry works," Noir argued. "The element of surprise is the concealed carrier's superpower. Criminals walk around thinking they've got the drop on everybody --- but they never know who they're running up on."

He called the armed citizen a "wolf dressed like a sheep," and said every criminal should second guess their next move out of fear they'll pick the wrong target.

Despite the suspect's actions, his family quickly began trying to reframe the story. "He was a good kid," his grandmother told local reporters. Noir responded, "Good kids don't steal Toyotas and rob women at gunpoint."

Even a local gang figure chimed in, calling the spree "just some bad habits." Noir wasn't having it: "That's not forgetting to do your homework. That's armed robbery three times in under 20 minutes."

Bottom Line: An armed citizen in Chicago stopped a violent robbery spree with decisive force. And while critics may try to rewrite the story, the facts are simple: concealed carry saves lives --- especially when criminals push their luck too far.
