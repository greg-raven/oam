Violent crime fell during the first six months of 2013 --- at the same time the number of gun purchases was expanding.

According to preliminary FBI stats, "All offenses in the category of violent crime" fell during the first six months of 2013, compared to the same time period in 2012.

UPI reports that this included "murder, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, \[and\] aggravated assault and robbery." Specifically, "murders declined by 6.9 percent, forcible rapes declined 10.6 percent, aggravated assaults decreased 6.6 percent and robbery offenses were down by 1.8 percent."

On January 6, 2014, Breitbart News reported that background checks for gun purchases had skyrocketed in 2013, particularly in the early part of the year, which coincides with the period of time in which, according to FBI stats, crime fell.

Throughout 2013 as a whole, there were 21,093,273 background checks, compared to 19,592,303 in 2012.
