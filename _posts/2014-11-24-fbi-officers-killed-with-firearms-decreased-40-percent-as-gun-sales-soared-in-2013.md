On November 24 the FBI released stats showing the number of officers killed in the line of duty during 2013 decreased by approximately 40 percent at a time when private gun sales were breaking records.

According to the FBI, 26 officers were "feloniously killed" with firearms in 2013. This figure is down from the 44 "feloniously killed" with firearms in 2012, and far below the 63 officers killed with firearms in 2011.

The number of officers "feloniously killed" with firearms has fallen as the number of annual private gun sales has risen.

[...]

The FBI previously confirmed that violent crime against private citizens also fell in 2013.
