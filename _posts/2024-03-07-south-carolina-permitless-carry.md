South Carolinians can now legally carry handguns without a permit.

In a closed-door ceremony Thursday, Gov. Henry McMaster signed H. 3594, known as the "Second Amendment Preservation Act," or commonly called "constitutional carry."

The law, which took effect after the governor's signature, now allows gun owners ages 18 and older to openly carry firearms without a permit.

"With my signature, South Carolina is now the 29th state in the country with constitutional carry," McMaster posted on X, formerly Twitter. "This bill expands the Second Amendment rights of our law-abiding citizens and will keep violent criminals behind bars with increased penalties for illegal gun use and possession."

South Carolina is now the 29th state to pass permitless carry legislation. The others are:

State Rep. Brandon Cox, a Berkeley Republican, said on the floor Tuesday the bill not only advances gun owners' constitutional rights but also addresses gun crime.

"[Louisiana signed this bill into law this morning]({% post_url 2024-03-05-louisiana-constitutional-carry %}), and those states have not become the wild, wild west," Cox said.

The law includes increased penalties for illegal gun possession, and it shortens the window for gun owners to report their stolen weapons. It also includes statewide state-paid training classes.

Firearms are still banned in locations where guns are banned now, including courthouses, schools, and the Statehouse. Gun owners can still get a concealed weapons permit.

Tre'Von Barber, a Fort Mill-based South Carolina Law Enforcement Division-approved firearms instructor, said he likes that gun rights are further expanded in South Carolina. But, Barber added, "there needs to be an educational component when it comes to gun safety and protection."

Not every legislator is supportive of the new law.

The amended legislation, negotiated by six legislators from the state House and Senate this week, passed the lower chamber Tuesday mainly along party lines by an 86-33 vote.

"This is something I'm deeply troubled we're doing," state Rep. Seth Rose, D-Richland, said Tuesday on the floor. "I have friends and citizens from both political parties ... come up to me and say, 'What are y'all doing? What are you thinking?'"

The negotiated proposal passed the Senate 28-18, again, mostly along party lines.

One Democrat, state Sen. Mike Fanning of Fairfield, voted to pass the legislation.

Republican Sens. Chip Campsen of Charleston, Tom Davis of Beaufort and Luke Rankin of Horry opposed the bill.

"I submit to you that the only reason why this was done and this was passed in this chamber on a partisan vote mostly is because this is an election year," state Sen. Margie Bright Matthews, D-Colleton, told television news station WCNC.

Meanwhile law enforcement, which pushed for increased penalties for illegal gun use and possession, say they also have concerns.

"I said a prayer last night that Richland County does not turn into the wild, wild west," Richland County's Sheriff Leon Lott told SC Public Radio in an email. "This is a win for the criminals, who can now walk around with a gun and law enforcement cannot do anything about it."

JJ Jones, executive director of the S.C. Law Enforcement Division, said in a statement that law enforcement will continue its "mission to protect the streets of South Carolina."

"Our job is to enforce laws as written and we will do that professionally, as we are sworn to do," Jones said.

McMaster, in a statement before the signing Thursday, said the expanded gun law is a step toward closing the so-called revolving door for violent criminals.

"Now, law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges can keep career violent criminals behind bars where they belong, where they can no longer hurt innocent South Carolinians," he said.
