PHOENIX (AP) --- Arizona residents are one step closer to getting a tax credit for attending a firearms safety class after Republican lawmakers passed a measure offering a dollar-for-dollar credit for concealed-carry permit holders Monday.

A House panel passed the tax credit in what could become the first of its kind in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

House Majority Leader Steve Montenegro, R-Litchfield Park, sponsored the bill to create a tax credit up to $80 for people who get a concealed weapons permit. The measure would only affect those who get the permit after it is enacted.

The Republican lawmaker said his measure encourages gun safety and education.

"I think that these are lessons in firearm safety that are appropriate for the next generation of firearm users."

When asked about the cost by Rep. Bruce Wheeler, D-Tucson, Montenegro said "You know, you can't really put a price on safety."

State officials say Arizona has more than 250,000 registered carriers as of January. To get a permit, individuals must be over 21, go through a background check and have some firearms training.
