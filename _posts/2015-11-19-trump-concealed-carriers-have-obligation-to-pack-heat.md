Donald Trump, the leading Republican for president, said concealed carry permit holders don't just have a right to cart their guns around --- they have an actual "obligation," he said.

In a statement to Breitbart, Trump spoke of the 13 million or so concealed carry permit holders in the United States --- a fraction of the 100 million gun owners --- and said those with concealed carry permits are holding their Second Amendment rights most dear.

"The concept of concealed carry is as much intended to deter criminal activity as it is to provide direct defense of those who have those permits," Trump said, to Breitbart. "Not all concealed carry permit holders 'carry' all the time. Thus, the deterrent value is that those who might contemplate criminal behavior will think twice when that doubt exists."

He went on, acknowledging that "carrying a weapon is not always feasible or appropriate," but tensions around the world demand it be considered.

"Each permit holder must make the decision to carry or not carry," Trump said. "I will carry more often than I have in the past and I am sure other concealed permit holders will do the same. Do we have an obilgation to carry? The answer is 'yes,' but we must do it in such a way as to raise serious doubts in the minds of those who might be considering violence in America."

And his main point?

"Deterring violence is far better that dealing with the aftermath of an act of terror," he said. "Less blood, more security. That is what will make America great again."

Breitbart also reported Nashville talk radio host Ralph Bristol claiming similarly over the weekend. During a Saturday show, he said, "concealed carry permit holders have a duty to be armed," given especially the terror attacks in Paris, the news outlet reported.
