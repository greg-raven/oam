Actor Vince Vaughn says he supports gun owner's rights, "We don't have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government," Vaughn recently told a magazine.

The True Detective star made the comments to British GQ magazine when asked about gun rights in America.

"I support people having a gun in public full stop, not just in your home. We don't have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government," Vaughn said.

"It's not about duck hunting; it's about the ability of the individual. It's the same reason we have freedom of speech. It's well known that the greatest defense against an intruder is the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back. All these gun shootings that have gone down in America since 1950, only one or maybe two have happened in non-gun-free zones."

Vaughn went on to advocate for guns in the classroom, telling British GQ, "You think the politicians that run my country and your country don't have guns in the schools their kids go to? They do. And we should be allowed the same rights. Banning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop making people fat."

The full interview is to be published in the British GQ on June fourth.
