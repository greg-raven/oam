If you don't exercise your rights, they become weak and flabby.

- I believe that it is the right of law-abiding citizens under the 2nd Amendment, which reads in part that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

- I think it is my duty as a human to be able to protect myself and my property.

- I think it is my duty as a person to be able to protect my loved ones.

- I think it is my duty as a citizen to be able to help stop criminal activity --- even violent criminal activity --- to extent that this is possible in any given circumstance.

- I think it is my duty as a citizen to help law enforcement officers who may need assistance in carrying out their lawful duties.

- I believe that society is safer when the criminals don't know who is armed.

- I believe I should have the same right of self defense as law enforcement officers, who as I understand it do not carry weapons for my protection but rather for theirs.

- As an armed citizen who is already on the scene of a violent situation, I will be able to react in moments, rather than waiting for the arrival of law enforcement officials.

- I believe that more guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens results in less crime.

- As shown by events in [Palm Desert]({% post_url 2009-11-19-shots-fired-palm-desert-california %}), Killeen, Columbine, Portland, Fort Hood, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Newtown, Clackamas Town Center, San Antonio, and far too many other parts of the country, psychopaths seem to be drawn to areas they perceive to be free of law-abiding armed citizens. As John R. Lott Jr. points out, "With just one exception, every public mass shooting in the USA since at least 1950 has taken place where citizens are banned from carrying guns."

- As many have shown over the years --- including [Joel Myrick]({% post_url 1997-10-11-town-tries-to-cope-with-school-shooting %}) in Pearl, Mississippi, and Dave Young in Flagstaff, AZ --- an armed citizen can make a difference for the better. According to Florida criminalist Gary Kleck, 2.5 million Americans each year use a firearm for self-defense. Of that number, 400,000 people believe that, were it not for the gun they used, they would have been killed.
- With officials exporting criminals and other undesirables to the high desert to reduce crime in Los Angeles County, we now have more criminals and seemingly more crime in the high desert.

- With [AB 109]({% post_url 2012-10-06-crime-is-up-on-anniversary-of-ab-109 %}), there will be ever-more dangerous criminals roaming our streets.

- With doctors prescribing ever-more young patients take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) --- a psychotropic drug linked to 90 percent of school shootings --- it seems only a matter time before other armed psychotics attempt other mass public shootings.

- With self-serving politicians seeking further to limit or remove our guaranteed rights under the Constitution and natural law, each of us who cares about our country and that for which it stands must exercise our rights lest they become flabby from disuse. This is part of my effort along those lines.

- Carrying a gun is important because when seconds count, police are minutes away.

- There are many examples of [situations](/category/situations/) where a law-abiding armed citizen did make or could have made a difference.
