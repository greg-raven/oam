A quiet rebellion is spreading across New Jersey. And it has nothing to do with gas pumps or pork roll.

A grassroots wave of 2A [Second Amendment] activism has now pushed 12 municipalities to nullify their local permit-to-carry fees, putting real money back into the pockets of gun owners and firing a shot across the bow of the state's anti-gun machine.

The latest to join the movement is Howell, N.J., which passed its rebate resolution on Nov. 25. That makes an even dozen towns stepping up to refund their residents after New Jersey lawmakers piled on extra fees post-*Bruen.*

## How We Got Here: Bad Fees Meet Good Pushback

After the Supreme Court's *Bruen* decision opened up the right to carry, New Jersey legislators responded with more hoops and higher costs. Among them:

- $50 diverted to a victims compensation fund (struck down by the 3rd Circuit as unconstitutional).

- $150 kicked to municipalities.

But small towns weren't having it. Englishtown was first to say, "Nope," refunding the $150 back to applicants. Now Howell has joined the roster, unanimously agreeing (with one council member absent) to return $125 of its cut.

## A Dozen Towns, One Message: Respect the Right

"These municipalities have decided to respect the rights of their citizens," said Alan Gottlieb, CCRKBA [Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms] Chairman.

He added that every new resolution weakens the hold of "anti-liberty forces" in the Garden State. And praised the combined grassroots firepower of CCRKBA, NRA-ILA [National Rifle Association-Institute for Legislative Action], and NJFOS [New Jersey Firearms Owners Syndicate] members who pushed this movement forward.

The list of towns now rejecting the unconstitutional fee structure includes:

Beachwood, Butler, Dumont, Franklin Borough, Hardyston, Hopatcong, Medford Lakes, Vernon, Englishtown, Howell, plus Cresskill and Readington, which went even further by passing ordinances instead of simple resolutions.

Howell Councilman Ian Nadel, who led the effort locally, summed it up bluntly.

"The Second Amendment is the only Amendment that seems to be under repeated attack, especially in the state of New Jersey," he quipped.

## The Impact? Over $125,000 Saved Every Year

According to the organizations involved, nearly 200,000 New Jerseyans stand to benefit as an estimated $125,000+ in unjustifiable fees disappear annually. That's a real-world win in a state where exercising your rights often comes with a price tag.

And this movement isn't done.

If gun owners in other towns want to advance their own rebate resolution, NJFOS is inviting them to reach out for assistance. A joint policy brief and model resolution are also available for anyone ready to take the next step.
