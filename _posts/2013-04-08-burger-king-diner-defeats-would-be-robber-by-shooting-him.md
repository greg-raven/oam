A father who was trying to eat with his family at Burger King was able to defeat an armed robber by pulling his own weapon and shooting at him, Miami police said.

It was at the height of lunch time, about 1 p.m., when a would-be robber walked into a Burger King, flashed his gun at one of the family diners, and demanded the diner fork over money and valuables, police said in a CBS report. The robber was exiting when the father, who feared for his and his family's life, CBS said, took out his own gun and shot the suspect in the leg.

The suspect then fled in his Ford F-150. Police later found him --- 36-year-old Travis Harris --- and the driver of the truck, 38-year-old Ramon Smalls, at a gas station down the road, CBS said.

The pair was linked to another robbery of a woman that took place earlier that day, CBS said. Mr. Harris was taken to the hospital for treatment and was charged with three counts of armed robbery, police said.
