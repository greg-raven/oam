On February 22, the West Virgina Senate voted 24-9 in support of legislation removing the requirement for a license to carry a concealed handgun in the state.

It is already legal to openly carry a handgun without a license in West Virginia.

On February 8, Breitbart News reported the West Virginia House passed the legislation --- HB 4145 --- by a margin of 68-31. And the NRA-ILA reports the bill will now be sent back to the House "for a concurrence vote."

HB 4145 is sponsored by Rep. Saira Blair (R-Berkley), who recognizes the Second Amendment is a sufficient carry permit for state residents aged 21 and older. Similar legislation was passed in 2015 but was vetoed by Governor Earl Ray Tomblin (D) after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense In America came out in opposition to the bill.
