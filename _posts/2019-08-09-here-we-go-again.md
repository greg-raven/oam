In the aftermath of another deranged killer using a gun as the tool to commit his homicidal and suicidal acts of violence, the hand-wringing gun grabbers are at it again. They are wasting no time in exploiting the deaths of innocent people by pointing their finger at GUNS as the cause of the carnage and wanting to ban them.

Although these crimes are horrific and over-publicized by the media, the facts indicate there are TWICE as many people killed by shootings in Chicago EACH YEAR than in ALL of the mass shootings on US soil each year. Of course, Chicago already has STRICT gun control. That's not the story the gun grabbers and media want you to see.

Another fact the gun grabbers and media hide from you is that gun ownership has dramatically and steadily INCREASED nationwide over decades while the national murder rate has steadily DECREASED, which proves without question, on a national scale, that MORE GUNS=LESS CRIME.

So the gun grabbers are DEAD WRONG. Anybody who continues to place the blame on guns, instead of attacking the REAL cause of these mass shootings, has blood on their hands from EVERY mass shooting since Columbine.

WHY? Because whenever you are trying to correct a bad statistic, you must analyze ALL of the factors that may be causing the unacceptable problem you are trying to correct. There may be several factors, but ONE, is the RIGHT TARGET to attack, and when attacked, will cause an immediate correction of the problem.

Find the RIGHT Target, attack it, and the bad statistic immediately and positively responds.

Attack the wrong target and the bad situation will not improve, and in many cases gets worse.

In analyzing statistics of mass shootings, there are several factors (targets) that have been talked about as the cause of the shootings, including access to guns, lack of proper mental health care, violence in movies, television, and video games.

The danger in lumping all of these factors into the "cause" of mass shootings is that it appeases the public and tricks them into thinking "something has been done" but it hides the RIGHT target and mass shootings not only do not stop, they become more frequent and deadlier, as we have witnessed yet again.

Isn't that EXACTLY what we have seen over the last 40 years? We have picked the wrong target because had we selected the right target and attacked it 40 years ago, mass shootings would have stopped. But they have not stopped, they have become more frequent and more deadly.

So what have we targeted as a society to try to stop these mass murders that have clearly been the wrong target?

**Guns are the wrong target.**

Why?

Because prior to these shootings, there were just as many guns per capita and there was unrestricted access to semiautomatic weapons, even for young adults and kids. But even more evidence that guns are the wrong target is the undeniable fact that in towns, cities, schools, and shopping malls, where guns have been severely restricted and in some cases outright banned, the statistic of murder, HAS NOT DROPPED, IT HAS INCREASED!

Even greater evidence that proves guns are the wrong target is found in towns, cities, schools, and shopping malls where law-abiding, responsible citizens are allowed to carry concealed weapons. In those areas where guns are the least restricted, we see the statistic of murder and violent crime HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY.

So if the RIGHT TARGET IS NOT GUNS, what is the right target?

Well, let's first look at the other targets being offered up ... Violence in TV, Movies and Video Games.

If you are old enough to remember when America did not have kids walking into schools and killing their classmates with guns, then you remember when you could walk to school with your .22 rifle because you were on the school's rifle team, and prop your rifle up against the cabinet in the back of your classroom. You also likely remember the TV shows and movies you watched as a kid, as well as the games you played with all the other kids ...

You watched westerns and war movies that had lots of killing in them. You played Cops and Robbers, Cowboys and Indians.

Remember those games? If you had the money, you had toy cap guns to use and if you didn't have the money you made toy weapons out of sticks or whatever you could fashion to look like a Tommy Gun or lever action rifle or bow and arrow. And yes, you killed the bad guy every chance you could get. And yes, every now and then someone you shot said you didn't shoot him and it might lead to an argument, a wrestling match or a few punches thrown to settle it. BUT YOU NEVER, EVER THOUGHT OF GRABBING THE REAL GUN that was unlocked and readily accessible in your closet at home, and taking it to school to shoot your classmates.

The TV, movie industry, and video game industry have placed warning labels and age restrictions on violent shows and games, but it has not made a difference in mass shootings. WHY? Because such restrictions were the WRONG TARGET!

Had that step of restricting violent media been the right target, we would have seen a positive change, a decrease in mass shootings, and we have not.

WHY have we NOT seen a change in mass shootings after restricting violent media from our youth? Because kids and young adults KNOW THE DIFFERENCE between a violent TV show, movie, or video game and real life, just as you and I did 40 or more years ago when we played, Cops and Robbers, Cowboys and Indians, and GI Joe.

So that leaves improving mental health care as the only remaining target that has been talked about as a solution to stop mass shootings. Believe it or not, lawmakers are suggesting the cause of these mass shootings is the inability of the State to involuntarily commit people who show signs of mental illness!

Do you see the inherent insanity in such a target? With a government already gone wild in stripping freedoms and privacy after 9/11, now there are actually lawmakers talking about increasing the power of the government to involuntarily commit (that means against your will) citizens to a mental institution! Remember the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?

These are the same lawmakers who champion gun control laws and banning violent media content as the solution to stop mass shootings. They say that due to lack of funding, we have released so many "crazy" people from a mental institution into the streets, which has caused the increase in mass shootings.

Really? How many mass shooters have been homeless, mental derelicts who lacked a psychiatrist treating them and prescribing them medication? NOT ONE.

So if the RIGHT TARGET to stop mass shootings is NOT GUNS, and it is NOT VIOLENT MEDIA, and it is NOT MORE MENTAL HEALTH CARE, then WHAT IS IT?

To find the RIGHT TARGET look to see what CHANGES took place in society when mass shootings first began and what has increased in society directly and proportionally to the increase in mass shootings, even during the same time when strong actions and restrictions against guns and violent media were being implemented to stop the mass shootings.

The answer, the common denominator, the RIGHT TARGET in the ever-increasing number of mass shootings was and continues to be the creation of strong, mind-altering, psychiatric drugs by the pharmaceutical companies and their systematic pushing of these drugs to our children and youth through our public school system, and the endless assault of prescribing anti-depression medication for adults. These drugs create the monsters who are killing their parents, teachers and schoolmates and the public at large.

**Let me make a bold statement here: When the medical authorities complete their blood chemistry on the latest mass murderer, THEY WILL FIND PSYCH DRUGS in his system.**

**Bold statement? Not really. EVERY MASS SHOOTER SINCE COLUMBINE HAS BEEN ON PSYCH DRUGS!**

When I recognized psych drugs being pushed on our youth as the right target after the Columbine shootings. I stated it then and I have stated it after every mass shooting since and guess what, EVERY SHOOTER has been under psychiatric care, taking these powerful, mind-altering drugs that are scientifically proven to create homicidal and suicidal urges in those being prescribed these drugs!

It is the RIGHT TARGET. Ban the prescription and distribution of these strong, mind-altering drugs and as a society, we will not have drug-induced assassins killing innocent people.

Of course to do so, would take multi-billions of dollars in ridiculous profits from the pharmaceutical companies who through their relentless "lobbying" in Washington, DC have managed to not only stay in business when all evidence points at their product as the root cause of these mass shootings, they also convinced Congress years ago to pass legislation allowing the blatant advertising of antidepressant drugs on TV, radio, Internet, newspapers, and magazines.

Now you understand one of the reasons why members of Congress, who receive huge political contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, avoid attacking the RIGHT TARGET, psych drugs, and continue to point fingers at the wrong target ... your guns.

The latest shooting is no different. It is not about hate or easy access to guns. It is about the anti-social, psychopathic effects of psychiatric drugs that are irresponsibly forced on society from the cradle to the grave through pharmaceutical marketing budgets that are larger than the gross national product of many third world countries and the drug pushing psychiatrists and medical doctors who prescribe them.

My efforts to spread the truth that it is NOT guns, but rather psych drugs that are doing the killing is being heard and more mainstream media sources are finally spreading the truth with me.

[See this article](https://www.wnd.com/2015/06/big-list-of-drug-induced-killers/) and help me spread the truth by forwarding this e-mail to all on your lists and asking them to do the same.

If we truly want to stop mass shootings, we have to ban the prescription and distribution of these strong, mind-altering drugs and as a society we will not have drug induced assassins killing innocent people. At the same time, we must strengthen those aspects of society that have statistically provided a positive reduction in violent crime. Namely, allow the law-abiding responsible citizenry to carry concealed weapons to protect against mass shootings.

New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles ... the big cities, with the strictest gun control have the highest murder and violent crime rates. Allow law-abiding, responsible citizens to be trained to carry a concealed weapon, and those same cities with the highest murder and crime rates will see an immediate and permanent reduction in violent crime and murder as all the other towns and cities across America have seen when they allowed their citizens to carry concealed weapons.

I have been preaching this for years. Direct our lawmakers to the RIGHT TARGET. IT'S NOT GUNS!

Others are now seeing it too. Help spread the word.

Watch this video from Citizens Committee on Human Rights. They have done the hard research and now say the same thing I said over 15 years ago ...

And never forget what gun control is REALLY about. It is not about controlling guns, it is about controlling people.

Lawmakers who want to disarm you really want to control you. History is full of governments who first registered guns, then confiscated guns, then rounded up and systematically killed those who the government deemed were trouble makers ...

170 million of them!

Don't think it could not happen here. Look at the freedom and liberties we have lost since 9/11. Sandy Hook Elementary is just another scapegoat to take another step at controlling the American people.

After every mass shooting, we hear the unenlightened politicians and knee-jerk liberals wailing, "If we can save just ONE life by getting guns off the street, then it is worth passing stricter gun control ..."

Well, the next time you hear that from anybody, I want you to respond with: "Over 170 million people would disagree with you ... if they could. You can't talk with them, because they are dead! They were killed by their own governments after strict gun control disarmed them."

Then I want you to hand them a copy of Innocents Betrayed, an award-winning documentary DVD that I co-produced with Aaron Zelman and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO).

\[...\]

Well, I co-produced Innocents Betrayed because it dramatically and irrefutably documents the direct connections between government gun control schemes and the subsequent genocides that have taken the lives of over 170 million people!

This is a must-see DVD because it contains documented, proven facts of history that even the most ardent gun control advocate cannot deny.

Watch a short trailer of this riveting and educational film. Then order your own copies to share with your family, friends and co-workers. All proceeds go directly to JPFO and assist in their efforts to educate Americans and expose the fallacy of gun control.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPk78Iuecxw" title="Innocents Betrayed"></iframe>

I personally put my money where my mouth is to co-produce the DVD because the message is so important to the future of our country and our offspring. The dangers of gun control are real. Innocents Betrayed exposes them in such an undeniable manner in this DVD that you simply must have it in any well-stocked information arsenal for sharing with anyone who thinks otherwise.

And until our government wakes up and bans pharmaceutical advertising in all forms of media, and the medical community takes appropriate responsibility and action against those doctors who are creating these mass killing monsters through the prescription of known, violence inducing drugs, please consider getting armed and trained. With 1 in 5 American taking psych drugs, the next killings could be at your school, church, or workplace!
