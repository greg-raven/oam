North Carolina's state legislature has voted to override Gov. Roy Cooper's (D) veto and repeal the state's requirement for a resident to obtain a permit from a local sheriff before legally purchasing a handgun.

Senate Bill 41 passed in the state's House of Representatives in a 71 to 46 vote on Wednesday. The state Senate previously voted 30 to 19 on Tuesday in approval of the measure.

Republicans have a supermajority in the Senate and did not need Democratic votes to override Cooper.

In the House, three Democrats weren't present at Wednesday morning's vote, meaning that state Republicans only need 71 votes to override Cooper's veto instead of 72.

The repeal will take effect immediately, according to The Associated Press.

The enacted bill would also allow guns on some school properties where religious services are held.
