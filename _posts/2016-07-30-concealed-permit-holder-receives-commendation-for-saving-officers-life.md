Ohio concealed permit holder Dylan DeBoard received a commendation July 27 for intervening to save the life of a Mount Vernon Police Officer who was under attack.

Corporal Micheal Wheeler was "attacked by a homeless crystal meth addict" in 2015 and DeBoard ran to his aid, handgun drawn.

According to The Washington Times, Wheeler said the meth addict had him pinned to the ground and was trying to take his gun at the very moment that Deboard stepped in. The suspect ceased fighting and "put his hands in the air" when he saw DeBoard's gun.

Wheeler was then able to push the suspect off, roll him over, and place him in handcuffs.

DeBoard was given the Mount Vernon's Citizen's Award of Valor. It was awarded to DeBoard by Wheeler himself.
