A North Dakota police department wants to make sure school resource officers are on equal footing with anyone who may try to harm students, so it has requested some upgraded weapons, according to the Associated Press.

The Bismarck Police Department, in its 2019 budget request, is asking for money to purchase AR-15s, gun safes to store them in, as well as bulletproof vests and medical kits.

"I fully believe that we have some solid preventative measures in place, and generally our schools are safe," said Lt. Jason Stugelmeyer. "But we have to do everything we can to be prepared for something if it did happen."
