Property crimes are on the decline in the High Desert but violent crime rose last year in some local communities, according to annual county crime statistics released by First District Supervisor Robert Lovingood's office Tuesday.

At all San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department stations in the Victor Valley and Barstow areas, nonviolent "Part II" crimes in 2014 were down from 2013. The Barstow sheriff's station saw the most drastic decline, with nonviolent and property crimes down 19 percent in 2014. Hesperia was next with a 10 percent decrease, followed by the Apple Valley and Victor Valley stations, which both had 8 percent decreases from 2013 to 2014. Adelanto saw a 5 percent decrease and Victorville saw a drop of 2 percent.

Meanwhile, the statistics showed violent crimes increased at the Victorville Station, Apple Valley Station and Victor Valley Station (which covers unincorporated areas of the valley). In Victorville, violent "Part I" crimes were up 10 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013, the largest increase in the area. Simple assault calls were up to 816 from 510 the year before, a 60 percent increase. Burglary, rape and aggravated assault reports were also up, but each saw less than a 20 percent increase.

"Simple assault calls were up, and it's truly hard to predict and police those calls," Victorville Sheriff's Station Capt. Sam Lucia said Tuesday evening. "Generally, simple assaults are crimes of emotion and can occur at any time and anywhere people interact. It occurs in an instant ... with or without provocation."

Apple Valley's 1 percent violent crime increase came from a 50 percent jump in rape cases: The station reported 18 rapes in 2014, up from 12 in 2013. Aggravated assault cases were also up in Apple Valley from 109 in 2013 to 139 in 2014. \[...\]
