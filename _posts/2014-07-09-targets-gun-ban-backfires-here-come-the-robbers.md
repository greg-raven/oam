- Major retailer's firearms policy creates danger for customers

Within three days of a new policy asking customers not to bring their guns to Target stores, reports have surfaced of armed attacks on customers.

\[...\]

Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thought Target made a poor decision.

"That's what happens in gun-free zones," he told WND. "They actually should be called victim-enrichment zones because that's what they are. If anyone wants to commit a crime with impunity, take your gun where there are no guns. You can do what you want, get in and get out and there's nobody to stop you.

"If you notice where most of the so-called mass shooting are happening, they're in gun-free zones," Henry continued. "You don't see them at gun shows or at gun stores. You don't see people walk in there and start shooting. They're not going to do it because they know everybody in there is armed."

Henry said he believes at least two groups are operating in Georgia with financial backing from Bloomberg.

"He's paying a couple of groups down here. One is Moms Demand Action and the other is Mayors Against Illegal Guns," he said.

Henry said he refers to the latter group as "Illegal Mayors Against Guns" because its members are far more likely to commit a felony than any licensed gun holder in states like Georgia or Texas.

"Somebody did the math, and if you are a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns then you are 82 times more likely to commit a felony than a licensed gun holder in Texas," he said. "If you Google 'gun owners against illegal mayors' you'll see all those mayors who have been convicted of or arrested (on charges of) felonies."

Henry likes to remind skeptics that very few businesses, even those owned by gun control advocates, will post a sign advertising that guns aren't allowed.

Taco Mac, an Atlanta-based Mexican eatery, did that several years ago and it backfired.

"They'd been in business for 29 years and never had a robbery," Henry said. "After we passed our update to the Georgia carry laws in 2008 allowing us to carry in restaurants that served alcohol, as long as we didn't consume alcohol, Taco Mac posted a sign, and within nine months they had their first robbery."

It didn't take that long when Jack in the Box restaurants made a similar demand.

In fact, there have been four robbery reports in the few weeks after the change was announced.
