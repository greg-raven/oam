- 1 dead; 3 wounded; 14-year-old charged

EDINBORO, Pennsylvania (CNN) --- Students and teachers at a northwestern Pennsylvania middle school met with counselors Saturday, trying to come to terms with a shooting spree at a graduation dance Friday night that left a popular teacher dead and three others wounded.

A 14-year-old Parker Middle School student, Andrew Jerome Wurst, of nearby McKean, has been charged with one count of criminal homicide and three counts of aggravated assault in connection with the shootings. He is being held without bond in the Erie County Jail, and authorities say they will try him as an adult.

At about 9:40 p.m. EDT on Friday, police say Wurst, armed with a.25-caliber handgun registered to his father, shot science teacher John Gillette, 48, on the patio of a restaurant where a dance was being held for 240 students. He then walked inside and fired several shots, fleeing the scene through a rear exit, police say.

Gillette, who was shot in the head, died at the scene. Two 14-year-old boys were wounded by gunfire and treated and released from a local hospital. A female teacher was grazed by a bullet but did not require hospital treatment.

The restaurant's owner, James Strand, armed with a shotgun, pursued Wurst and persuaded him to give up his weapon and surrender in a nearby field, police say.
