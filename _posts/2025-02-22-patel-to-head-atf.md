Kash Patel, the new FBI Director, is expected to be named acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). This move, which could be finalized next week, raises concerns about the future of the ATF, which has faced criticism from conservatives and gun rights groups. The ATF, responsible for enforcing firearms laws, has been without a confirmed director since 2015.
