So Virginia gun owners just dodged a legislative bullet in the form of a proposed ban on so-called assault weapons. But a demographic bullet is still aimed right where it can do the most damage: the ballot box. The Great Replacement that Leftists celebrate --- even as they call it a racist conspiracy theory --- is the primary reason gun rights are in the crosshairs in Virginia and throughout the country. Immigration has consequences, meaning foreign-origin voters, and if the GOP doesn't figure that out soon, gun rights will go the way of Confederate statues, along with other American rights currently undreamt of.

Consider the most recent near-miss: Four moderate Democrats sided with Republicans in Virginia's Senate to block a ban on semi-automatic sporting rifles such as the AR-15. Magazines of more than 12 rounds were targeted, too.

This provoked some eloquent opposition. "The people of Virginia are demanding that someone, anybody that is in power, please stand up and defend the Second Amendment," said Sen. Amanda Chase, a gun-rights champion and GOP gubernatorial candidate. "If I am going to continue to do the law-abiding work of the people I am going to have to arm myself, so I went through all the training, got the licensing and all that and I will just tell you --- I won't miss" ['We don't need weapons of war': Va. Gov. Northam reacts to failed assault weapons ban, by Tim Barber, WJLA.com, February 18, 2020].

Senator Chase was right: Real Virginians are indeed demanding that someone defend their rights, as the massive gun-rights rally on January 20 surely showed. But the last election results showed something else: Non-white Third World immigrants in Richmond and Northern Virginia who put the Democrats in power in the last election are doing their best to take those rights away.

"The 2020 legislative session kicked off shortly after noon with several history-making firsts as women and people of color assumed leadership roles previously held only by white men for the last 400 years," gloated The Associated Press:

> One of the House's first acts was to elect Del. Eileen Filler-Corn as the new speaker, the first woman to serve in that role. She is also the first Jewish speaker.
>
> Her top deputy, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, is the first black woman to hold that role, and the House elected Suzette Denslow to be the first-ever female clerk. Ghazala Hashmi, who unseated a Republican incumbent to help Democrats flip the Senate, became that chamber's first Muslim female member.

The New York Times has published two separate articles that celebrate the immigrant-driven demographic displacement of white Virginians and what it means for those who still "cling to their guns or religion," as the presidential scion of a Kenyan immigrant famously put it.

"Guns, that is the most pressing issue for me," Indian engineer Vijay Katkuri told the Times of his vote for a Democrat. "There are lots of other issues, but you can only fix them if you are alive." Enthused the NYT, "once the heart of the confederacy, Virginia is now the land of Indian grocery stores, Korean churches and Diwali festivals" [How Voters Turned Virginia From Deep Red to Solid Blue, by Sabrina Tavernise and Robert Gebeloff, November 9, 2019].

The paper gleefully noted that 10 percent of Virginian voters are foreign-born, up from 3.6 percent in 1990, and that the white population in Katkuris' district has plummeted from 91 percent to 64 percent.

Such is the shift, the New York Times reported in its second tribute to The Great Replacement, that a Muslim woman born in India, Ghazal Hashmi, defeated an incumbent Republican in suburban Richmond:

> At the root of this district's --- and Virginia's --- political transition is a slow-moving demographic change, a new kind of suburbanization that is sweeping through national politics. From Atlanta to Houston, this pattern is repeating itself --- suburban housing developments gobbling up rural areas and farmland and lifting Democrats to power.

Of course, the GOP didn't help its cause last year by leaving 33 General Assembly races uncontested --- 10 in House, 23 in the Senate --- particularly given that Democrats control the House by a slim two votes and the Senate by 11. Nor can one ignore Michael Bloomberg's 90-caliber shot at gun rights: $2.5 million that overwhelmed the National Rifle Association's popgun [Mike Bloomberg's gun-control group just vastly outspent the NRA to help Democrats win in Virginia, by Lauren Hirsch, CNBC, November 6, 2019].

But demographics are what mattered in the election and will matter long term, as MSNBC's Joe Scarborough cheerily explained.

Tweeted the ex-conservative:

And more than gun rights are at stake, thanks to The Great Replacement taking place before our very eyes.

The General Assembly quickly passed the Equal Rights Amendment, canceled the "Speaker's Bible Study" for an "interfaith devotional," and scrubbed "militia" from the name of the House Public Safety Committee. Not only does the House have its first woman Speaker, but blacks are also running half the chamber's 14 standing committees, including Appropriations [This is what a blue state looks like: Rapid change roils Virginia Republicans, by Gregory Schneider The Washington Post, January 27, 2020].

"The upshot is that white men from red parts of Virginia hold less power this year than any time since Reconstruction," WaPo's Schneider cheered.

That, of course, is why the Left wants Third World immigration. It erodes the political power of conservative, middle-American whites who defend traditional American rights such as free speech and gun ownership. "We can replace them," as the Times's Michelle Goldberg proclaimed in her walk-up to 2018's gubernatorial election in Georgia.

The worst thing is, few Republicans will admit this means doom not only for the party but also the Historic American Nation.

Never forget what Never Trumper Ben Shapiro tweeted about The Great Replacement: "And by the way, I don't give a good damn about the so-called 'browning of America.' Color doesn't matter. Ideology does."

That remark invited this rejoinder: "Of course you don't give a damn. You have the option to jump ship and move to Israel."

Exactly. The rest of us can't jump ship and have nowhere to go, which is why Virginia's Republicans and the party had better line up behind State Senator Amanda Chase and fight for gun rights.

But more than guns are at stake. Beyond that, the GOP must recognize what the left admits and crows about: "Demography is destiny," The Great Replacement is underway, and the Historic American Nation is under assault.

If the GOP doesn't fight it, Virginia --- and the rest of the country --- are doomed.
