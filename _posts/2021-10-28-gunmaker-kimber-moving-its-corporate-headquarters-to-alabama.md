TROY, Alabama --- Less than three years after selecting a site in Troy for a firearms manufacturing plant, Kimber Mfg Inc. announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to the Alabama city.

Kimber also said it plans to hire aggressively in all departments as it completes its new facility in Pike County.

The company's new headquarters is situated on 80-plus acres off Industrial Boulevard in Troy. Its Alabama facility spans more than 225,000 square feet and is home to industry-leading design engineering, product management and manufacturing capabilities.

After an exhaustive search, Kimber said Troy was chosen as its new corporate home for several reasons including the site's proximity to top-tier engineering schools as well as gun- and business-friendly support from the City of Troy and the State of Alabama.

The company, known as a leading manufacturer of premium firearms, was previously based in Yonkers, New York. Its 1911 handgun has been used by the U.S. Shooting Team, the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT, and an elite U.S. Marines unit.

"Kimber is a first-class firearms manufacturer with a reputation for precision craftsmanship, dependability and accuracy, which makes it just the kind of high-performance company we want operating in the state," said Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

**GROWTH PLANS**

Kimber said its Alabama expansion is well ahead of schedule, having filled hundreds of its planned Troy-based positions. The company announced plans for its Alabama manufacturing plant in January 2018.

Kimber is seeking qualified applicants across multiple positions and business areas including CNC technicians, machinists, quality control specialists, lean technicians, design engineers, compliance analysts, customer service representatives, materials planners, maintenance technicians, finishing operators, and assembly technicians.

"Kimber is a great place to work, especially if you love firearms," said Pedi Gega, the company's director of assembly and product finishing. "We have two indoor gun ranges, one outdoor range, a state-of-the-art design and prototype fabrication center, and a dynamic team of professionals who pride themselves in producing firearms with unmatched attention to detail, design and performance.

"Every Kimber firearm is created with a unique blend of advanced precision technology and authentic human craftsmanship," he said.
