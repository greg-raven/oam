A study released by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health declares there is no evidence "assault weapon" bans lead to a lower "incidence of fatal mass shootings."

The push for an "assault weapons" ban is central to the Democrats' gun control agenda nationally and is front and center for Democrats at the state level in places like Arizona and Virginia.

According to the Johns Hopkins study, researchers"did not find an independent association between assault weapon bans and the incidence of fatal mass shootings."

Researchers did claim licensing requirements like those in Connecticut help reduce the number of mass shootings, but their study omitted the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School in which 26 were killed at the school and another victim was killed in a private home.

In other words, a study which claims licensing reduces instances of mass shootings omitted one of the most often cited mass shootings in U.S. history, even though that shooting occurred in a licensing state.

Moreover, John Hopkins' criteria for licensing laws allowed them to bypass Illinois which, in turn, allowed them to sidestep the never ending gun crime of Chicago.

But the study was clear there is no evidence tying "assault weapons" to a lower incidence of mass shootings.
