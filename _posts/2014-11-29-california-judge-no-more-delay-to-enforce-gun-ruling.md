FRESNO (AP) --- A federal judge has rejected a request by the California attorney general to further delay his order overturning a 10-day waiting period for gun owners who want to buy more firearms.

U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii of Fresno ruled last week that he already gave six months from [his August decision]({% post_url 2014-08-23-ruling-in-silvester-v-harris %}) before the state must implement his order. The judge found no evidence that the cooling-off period prevents violence by people who already own guns.

Attorney General Kamala Harris asked for a delay until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has its say.

Harris argues that it will be expensive to hire and train workers or change the state's computer system to accommodate Ishii's ruling, which can be overturned. Kamala says that would waste the state's money and time.
