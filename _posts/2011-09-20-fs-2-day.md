Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is a weapons resort in southern Nevada. Whatâ€™s a weapons resort? Think about other resorts that feature golf or tennis or any other activity, and then imagine a resort where you go primarily to learn to shoot better. With classes and ranges dedicated to handguns, rifles, shotguns, and machine guns, Front Sight offers just about everything that just about any civilian, law enforcement officer, or member of the military needs to become proficient with a gun. Front Sight offers other specialty courses, too, as well as information to help guide you in the best practices for using a gun for self-protection, whether at home or in public. (Front Sight also offers classes to help you obtain a CCW permit for concealed carry.)
