One of my brothers was Commander of Bagram Air Base [Afghanistan] for 2 years, so I know this as fact.

One of the important functions Bagram had was to heavily guard the massive arsenal of our weapons which were stored there.

When Biden & Milley pulled out fast, those $85 billion of our assets were left behind for the Taliban, which included brand new:

- 358,530 assault rifles
- 126,395 pistols
- 64,363 machine guns

Other equipment:

- $50M in ammunition
- Over $1M mortar rounds
- 28,825 Humvees, including armored gun-trucks
- 900 combat vehicles
- 167 aircraft, including 33 Black Hawks, & 3 C-130 Hercules
- 42,000 pieces of night vision, surveillance, biometric & positioning equipment

In turn, the Taliban shared their newfound collection of weapons with their militant terrorist friends. [1 image below shows them selling the weapons]

Biden continues to fund terrorists, not only with cash, but our weapons.
