The incident occurred Sunday afternoon in broad daylight.

According to The Patch, the incident began when witnesses alleged they saw 49-year-old Bobby Martin Watson trying to rob a woman in a Publix parking lot. Pinellas County Sheriff's Office deputies indicate that the woman --- 44-year-old Rosanna Lynn --- struggled with Watson and he stabbed her.

Watson then ran and a witness --- 44-year-old Christopher McMann --- approached, only to get stabbed as well.

Deputies said a second good Samaritan --- 31-year-old Travis Jones --- then chased and tackled Watson, only to be "stabbed in the abdomen during the struggle that ensued." Forty-year-old Donald Rush saw what was happening, grabbed his gun from his vehicle and ran at Watson. He was able to take away the knife "and held [Watson] at gunpoint until deputies arrived."

Rush did not have to fire his gun. The sight of the brandished firearm was enough to stop the attack.

Watson was booked into the Pinellas County jail. He faces charges of "armed robbery and three counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon."
