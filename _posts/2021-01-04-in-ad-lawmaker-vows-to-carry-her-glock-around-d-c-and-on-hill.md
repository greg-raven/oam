One of the newest members of Congress, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), has kicked off the session with a [viral digital ad](https://twitter.com/laurenboebert/status/1345891049584132097?s=20) proclaiming her right to carry a [Glock](https://us.glock.com/) on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and in the streets of Washington.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me tell you why I WILL carry my Glock to Congress. <br><br>Government does NOT get to tell me or my constituents how we are allowed to keep our families safe.<br><br>I promise to always stand strong for our 2nd Amendment rights.<a href="https://t.co/E75tYpdN4B">https://t.co/E75tYpdN4B</a> <a href="https://t.co/qg7QGenrNo">pic.twitter.com/qg7QGenrNo</a></p>&mdash; Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenboebert/status/1345891049584132097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Boebert, the gun-toting owner of a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colo., released the video Sunday amid efforts by some Democrats to ban members of Congress from carrying guns on the grounds of the Capitol. On Monday, those efforts appeared poised to fail.
