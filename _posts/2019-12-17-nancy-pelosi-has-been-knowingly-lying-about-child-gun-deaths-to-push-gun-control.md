When even the left-leaning Washington Post calls a Democratic talking point a lie, you know it must be a doozy. And thanks to fact-checker Glenn Kessler, we now know that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly and knowingly lied about the rates of child gun death to push an agenda.

Consider this tweet from the California Democrat: "100 people die every day from gun violence --- 47 of them children & teenagers." Pelosi asked, "How many more must perish before \[Mitch McConnell\] will take action?" She has repeated the same or similar forms of this statistic, that 47 children and teenagers die every day from gun violence, in press releases, speeches on the House Floor, and comments to reporters.

It turns out that this isn't true. It's not even close. In reality, "seven children or teenagers are killed a day --- not 47." The Washington Post even reached out to the speaker's office, which claimed she "misspoke." But then, Pelosi kept repeating the fake statistic. In response, the newspaper's fact-checker awarded her "Four Pinocchios," the highest rating saved for lies that are truly "whoppers."

This is shameful conduct from Pelosi and her entire party. It's all politically motivated. She is trying to push an agenda of Second Amendment restrictions: supposedly universal background checks, raising the age to buy a gun to 21, bans on so-called "assault weapons" --- all crippling the Second Amendment.

These policies are foolish, and none would make us any safer. But Pelosi is certainly free to argue otherwise and to lie shamelessly by fabricating statistics in the course of doing so.
