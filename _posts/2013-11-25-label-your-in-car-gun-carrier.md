If you have a lockable gun safe in the trunk of your car, as is often required when transporting a weapon, put a sticker on the outside with the following text:

> The contents of this container are private. Voluntary consent to search is NOT granted. A search warrant is required for access. Owner invokes his right to remain silent. Owner wishes to cooperate with law enforcement, but must first consult with an attorney.
