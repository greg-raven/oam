- The government can't even deport the alien criminals

Statistics can be a cure for insomnia, but sometimes they can deliver the jolt of a thunderclap. Here's a thunderclap with a number on it: 165,527. That's the number of illegals in the United States who have been convicted of a crime and were turned loose by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.

The term "Homeland Security" becomes a misnomer when the government frees criminals --- particularly those who shouldn't be in the U.S. in the first place --- to kill, rob, rape, maim and kidnap again.

The astonishing number of released convicts among us emerged from testimony of ICE Director Sarah Saldana before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican, the chairman, pressed Ms. Saldana to explain why her agents released prisoners who included convicted murderers, sex criminals (recruits, perhaps, in "the war on women"), robbers, kidnappers and drunk drivers. "These are people that are here illegally, get caught, convicted, and you release them into the public," Mr. Chaffetz said.

Stephen Dinan of The Washington Times reported last week that ICE released 30,558 criminal illegals in 2014 alone, down slightly from 36,007 who were released in 2013. Among those let out that year were 193 convicted of murder, 426 of rape and other sexual crimes, 303 of kidnapping and 16,070 of driving drunk. A thousand of them committed new crimes after getting out of jail. Homegrown American criminals would kill, so to speak, to get the leniency reserved for foreigners. If all the 165,527 freed illegal convicts from across the country were gathered in one place, they would comprise a city the size of Springfield, Missouri; Sioux Falls, South Dakota or Ontario, California. They might be called America's own "foreign legion."

Rather than release them, deportation would be the logical end for the sneakers and criminals, but Ms. Saldana explains that it can take months and "even years to deport folks" because of the requirements of "due process." This enabled Apolinar Altamirano, an illegal Mexican immigrant, for one example of what can happen, to shoot Grant Ronnebeck, 21, an Arizona store clerk, in an argument over a pack of cigarettes. Altamirano was out of jail on bond after an earlier burglary.
