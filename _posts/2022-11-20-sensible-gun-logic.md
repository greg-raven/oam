- If gun control laws actually worked, Chicago would be as peaceful as Mayberry, USA.
- The Second Amendment makes more women equal than the entire feminist movement.
- Legal gun owners have 300 million guns and probably a trillion rounds of ammo. Seriously, folks, if we were the problem, you'd know about it real quick.
- When JFK was murdered, nobody blamed the rifle.
- The National Rifle Association murders 0 people and receives nothing in government funds. On the other hand, Planned Parenthood murders 350,000 babies yearly and receives $500,000,000 in tax dollars annually.
- I've no problem with vigorous background checks when it comes to firearms. But, while we're at it, let's do the same when it comes to immigration, voter I.D., and candidates running for office.
- A man who left 300,000 guns for the Taliban has the gall to be lecturing law-abiding gun owners about gun control.
