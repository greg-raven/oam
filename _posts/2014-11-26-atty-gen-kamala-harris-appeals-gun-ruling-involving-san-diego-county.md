The California attorney general Wednesday asked a full federal appeals court to review a controversial gun case in hopes the court will overturn a ruling by a three-judge panel that would make it easier for someone to legally carry a concealed weapon in public.

Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris asked the full 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the case that led to the 2-1 ruling in February that struck down a restrictive policy used by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department in determining who could receive a concealed weapons permit.

The Peruta decision, named for Edward Peruta, a journalist who was turned down for a concealed weapon permit, "recognized that our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms does not end at one's doorstep," Michel said.
