> **Latino voters favor raising minimum wage, government involvement in healthcare, stricter gun laws,** BY JENS MANUEL KROGSTAD, MARK HUGO LOPEZ AND ABBY BUDIMAN, Pew Research Center, February 20, 2020

> Latino View on Guns
> 
> Around seven-in-ten Hispanic voters (68%) say gun laws should be stricter than they are today, while 24% say current gun laws are about right. Only 7% say gun laws should be less strict. The survey was conducted several months after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, involving a suspect who said he targeted Mexicans.
> 
> Among Hispanic Democratic voters, 80% say gun laws should be stricter. Hispanic Republican voters are more evenly divided, with 44% saying gun laws should be stricter and 42% saying gun laws are about right.
> 
> Among the U.S. public, 59% of registered voters said in September that gun laws should be stricter, including 89% of Democratic voters and 27% of Republican voters.
> 
> A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found white Americans are more than twice as likely as Hispanics to report having a gun in their household (49% vs. 21%), while 32% of black adults said the same. In the same survey, 42% of Hispanics said they knew someone who had been shot, a similar share to whites (43%). Meanwhile, 57% of black Americans said this.

If you can't figure it out, we'll spell it for you: The Great Replacement in the USA means those inalienable rights the founding fathers left for their posterity will be outlawed once Democrats, aided by massive Hispanic immigration, take permanent power of state legislators and then the entire nation.

> The NRA will fall. It's inevitable: Just look at the demographics., by Adam Winkler, Washington Post, October 19, 2015
> 
> Polls show that whites tend to favor gun rights over gun control by a significant margin (57 percent to 40 percent). Yet whites, who comprise 63 percent of the population today, won't be in the majority for long. Racial minorities are soon to be a majority, and they are the nation's strongest supporters of strict gun laws.
> 
> An overwhelming majority of African Americans say that gun control is more important than gun rights (72 percent to 24 percent). While the African American population shows signs of slow growth, other racial minority groups are growing more rapidly --- and report even greater support for gun control.
> 
> The fastest-growing minority group in America is Latinos. Between 2000 and 2010, the nation's Latino population grew by 43 percent. Hispanics, which make up 17 percent of the population today, are expected to grow to 30 percent of the population in the coming decades.
> 
> Of course, the NRA will continue to fight, and fight hard, against gun control. But the heart of the organization's power is the voters it can turn out to vote, and they are likely to decline in number. Unless the organization begins to soften its no-compromises stance on gun safety legislation, it's likely to become increasingly marginalized in a changing America.
