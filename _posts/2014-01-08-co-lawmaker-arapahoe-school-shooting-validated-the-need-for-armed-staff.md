Colorado State Sen. Ted Harvey introduced a bill which would allow teachers and other staff to carry concealed guns on school property and, although the bill was introduced before the Arapahoe High School shooting in Centennial, Colorado, last month, Harvey claims that the introduction of yet another tragedy only reiterates the need for armed staff in our schools.

"It validated why I think an armed person in the school is a good thing," Harvey told Fox News.

"Not every school in Colorado has an armed guard roaming the halls," he added. "I think the situation that resulted at Arapahoe High School is not what we would have seen at other schools."

But the most recent school shooting struck a personal chord in Harvey as well. His own son attends Arapahoe High School and was on the debate team with Pierson. Additionally, Harvey's wife is a school teacher.

"I don't want my wife and kids to be sitting ducks," Harvey explained.

Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, weighed in on the matter. "We have armed security protecting banks and other valuables," he told Fox News. "Aren't our kids more valuable?"

"I don't think schools are safe when they are gun-free zones and criminals are the only people who carry guns. Then the others are sitting ducks and can't defend themselves," Harvey said.

In fact, during the 1999 Columbine shooting, the second deadliest school shooting in the U.S., at least 17 laws were broken by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold when they fatally shot 13 people and wounded 27 during the nightmare which lasted for nearly an hour.

"The biggest problem with gun-control laws, is that those who are intent on harming others ... are the least likely to obey them," economist, political commentator and author of [More Guns, Less Crime]({% post_url 2014-01-02-study-murder-rates-lower-where-concealed-weapons-allowed %}), John R. Lott explains.
