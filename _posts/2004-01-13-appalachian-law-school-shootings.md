Both Dr. John R. Lott, Jr., in his book The Bias Against Guns \[© 2003, Regnery --- Washington, D.C.\] and Bernard Goldberg in his most recent book, Arrogance \[© 2003, Warner --- New York, N.Y.\] discuss the shocking media bias and factual manipulation used by the Second Amendment-hating press to advance false information to fool the public. Both authors focused upon the same astonishing media manipulation that became evident in the case of the Appalachian Law School shootings back in 2002.

Quoting from Goldberg's book, "A student at the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia, who has just been told he will be suspended for failing grades, storms through the campus, clutching a handgun. As terrorized students run for their lives, they hear him say, 'Come get me, come get me.' But before anyone can get him, the student, a forty-two-year old immigrant from Nigeria, goes on a shooting spree, killing a dean, a professor, and a fellow student. He also shoots and wounds three other students --- one in the abdomen, one in the throat, and another in the chest."

Goldberg continues, "Finally, as the Washington Post reports, 'Three students pounced on the gunman and held him until help arrived.' Later in the story, the Post says, 'The students then tackled the gunman.' John Roberts at CBS News reported the story the very same way: 'Three people were killed ... before students tackled the suspect.' At NBC News, Kevin Tibbles said the students 'overpowered the gunman and held him until police could arrive.'"

Goldberg relates that, "The bloody incident happened on January 16, 2002, and was picked up by news organizations all over the country, almost all of which covered the story the way the Washington Post and the networks did. Which means virtually all of them left out one tiny, little fact. Two of the three students who 'pounced on' and 'tackled' and 'overpowered' the gunman, also had guns." Clearly, Mr. Goldberg was being sarcastic, and justifiably so.

Lott explains the actual encounter: "Mikael and Tracy were prepared to do something quite different: Both immediately ran to their cars and got their guns. Mikael had to run about one hundred yards to get to his car. Along with Ted Besen \[who was unarmed\], they approached Peter from different sides. As Tracy explains it, 'I stopped at my vehicle and got a handgun, a revolver. Ted went toward Peter, and I aimed my gun at \[Peter\], and Peter tossed his gun down. Ted approached Peter, and Peter hit Ted in the jaw. Ted pushed him back and we all jumped on.'"
