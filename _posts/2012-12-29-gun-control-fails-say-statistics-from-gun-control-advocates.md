After the Newtown, Connecticut mass murder, anti-rights politicians and media shifted into high gear. The only "solution" for such a tragedy was another gun ban; within two days, Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced her version. Pundits like the Washington Post's Ezra Klein politicized the tragedy by claiming that America is an unusually violent place, with the only answer being more gun control.

There's a problem with all of their hyperbole: it is based upon myth and manipulated data.

I personally believed in civilian disarmament until an acquaintance in law enforcement challenged my gun-banner's assumptions with questions and points I could not rebut. This began a research journey limited only by my decision to exclude any data cited by the NRA. At the time, I was convinced only caring people like the Brady Campaign would present the truth.

Surprisingly (to me, at the time), I found no dataset proving civilian disarmament made anybody safer.

In response to Ezra Klein's report titled "Twelve facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States," below are eight fictions about gun control.

Do note: all data cited below are from sources supportive of gun control.

- Fiction 1: Armed Resistance Does Not Stop Mass Murders \[...\]
- Fiction 2: Gun Control Eliminates "Dangerous Guns" While Protecting the Second Amendment \[...\]
- Fiction 3: "Gun Violence" \[...\]
- Fiction 4: Gun Control Will Make You Safer \[...\]
- Fiction 5: Gun Ownership Is Declining \[...\]
- Fiction 6: The U.S. Is One of the Most Violent Countries \[...\]
- Fiction 7: Gun Control Reduces Mass Murders \[...\]
- Fiction 8: Gun-Control Advocates Care About Other People, Gun-Rights Activists Are Selfish \[...\]
