On Friday, a Texas senator introduced the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2014 which would treat concealed carry permits similar to drivers' licenses, allowing permit holders to legally carry a concealed firearm between states without requiring a different permit for each state.

"This bill strengthens two of our nation's most fundamental rights, ensuring law-abiding gun owners can lawfully carry their weapons into like-minded states, while respecting the rights of states to adopt laws that are best-suited for the people of that state. This is an important affirmation of the Second Amendment and one that has been a top priority of law-abiding gun owners in Texas for some time. It is time to get this done," Senator John Cornyn, who sponsored the bill, stated in a news release.

"For all of us who are worried about these episodes of senseless gun violence, I think we can actually find a solution, not by encroaching on the rights of law-abiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights but by focusing on the areas where we can actually make a difference," Cornyn said last April.

The current bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Thune (R-SD), Vitter (R-LA), Graham (R-SC), Boozman (R-AR), Inhofe (R-OK), Crapo (R-ID), Burr (R-NC), Cochran (R-MS), Johanns (R-NE), Enzi (R-WY), Moran (R-KS), Roberts (R-KS), and Portman (R-OH).
