- GOA and GOC thank the Trump administration

Springfield, VA --- President Trump's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has revised its guidance of critical infrastructure to include the firearms industry as part of the Essential Critical Infrastructure. This revision comes shortly after Gun Owners of America (GOA) and Gun Owners of California (GOC) sent a letter to the administration urging inclusion of the firearms industry.

The guidance specifically includes "\[w\]orkers supporting the operation of firearm or ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors, and shooting ranges" as part of the Essential Critical Infrastructure.

GOA Senior Vice President Erich Pratt said, "It is very encouraging to see CISA include the firearms industry as essential. In these uncertain times, the ability to protect yourself --- and to acquire firearms, magazines and ammunition --- should not be ignored. GOA/GOC thanks the Trump Administration for listening to our letter and ensuring that Americans can protect themselves in these difficult times."

Erich Pratt, or another GOA spokesperson, is available for interviews. Gun Owners of America is a nonprofit lobbying organization dedicated to protecting the right to keep and bear arms without compromise. GOA represents over two million members and activists.
