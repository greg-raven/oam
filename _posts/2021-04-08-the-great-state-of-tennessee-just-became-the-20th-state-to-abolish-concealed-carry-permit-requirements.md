Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee tweeted a pic of himself signing a bill this week to nix permit requirements for law-abiding citizens of his state, age 21 and over (18 if member of the military), to carry a concealed firearm on their person.

> "It shouldn't be hard for law-abiding Tennesseans to exercise their 2A rights."
