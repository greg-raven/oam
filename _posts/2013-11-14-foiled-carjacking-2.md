A man driving with his vehicle's windows down was stopped at a red light when he was approached by another man he did not know.

The stranger pulled out a handgun, pointed it at the driver and demanded that he get out of the vehicle. Instead, the driver refused and pulled out his own registered firearm. After being confronted with the gun, the would-be robber fled the scene on foot.
