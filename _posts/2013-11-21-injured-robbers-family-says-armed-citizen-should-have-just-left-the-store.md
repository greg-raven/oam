The family of a suspect who was shot by an armed customer while attempting to rob a Family Dollar store in Mobile, Alabama earlier this month told Fox 10 that the Good Samaritan should not have gotten involved and "just left the store."

It was Tuesday, Nov. 12, when the armed citizen, whose identity has not been revealed, noticed 18-year-old Adric White wearing a mask and pointing a gun at employees towards the front of the store.

"He had the gun to his head. He had him on his knees," the man said. "I drew my gun on him and I said 'Hey, don't move.' At that point he swung around and before he had a chance to aim the gun at me, I fired."

The man added, "It was just instinct. It happened so quickly. I didn't want to shoot him, but when I saw him swing around so fast I didn't want to get shot either."

White was shot five times and transported to a local hospital where he is recovering and remains in police custody.

White was arrested in September for the armed robbery of The Original Oyster House, and was out on bond when he attempted to rob the Family Dollar store. \[...\]

Authorities maintain that the Good Samaritan was justified in shooting White and that he broke no laws when he did so. \[...\]
