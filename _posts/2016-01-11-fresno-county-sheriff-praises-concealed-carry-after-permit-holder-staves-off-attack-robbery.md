The man --- a retired sheriff's deputy with a California Concealed Weapon (CCW) permit --- was able to fight off being shocked with a stun gun in the neck and lower back while the attacker screamed orders for the would-be victim to hand over money.

The incident occurred at 5:15 a.m.

According to The Fresno Bee, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said the would-be victim ran from the ATM to his vehicle and was able to retrieve his gun. A woman driving the getaway car for the alleged robber then began ramming her vehicle into the armed victim's car. "The victim fired four rounds at the [getaway car], penetrating the vehicle and striking [the driver] in the leg. She crashed the car into a planter at the Starbucks coffee shop next to the ATM."

The 31-year-old driver of the getaway car --- Bobbie-Sue Alexandra Nicole Sevier --- "was taken to Community Regional Medical Center, where she was treated for the gunshot wound and booked into Fresno County Jail on charges of attempted robbery, assault, carjacking and other crimes."

The suspect with the stun gun --- "identified by Fresno police as [30-year-old] Jeremy Lynd" --- managed to escape on foot. Police think Lynd "might be connected to other crimes in the Sacramento area."

Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims responded to the incident by saying, "This is an example of why issuing CCWs to law-abiding citizens is important. The victim stopped the criminals from further serious injury to himself or others."
