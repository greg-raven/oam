A federal judge on Thursday rejected a short-term stay of a decision that blocked the District from enforcing a key provision of its restrictive concealed-carry laws --- prompting the city to move to issue carry permits to the gun owners who had sued after being denied permits.

However, U.S. District Judge Frederick J. Scullin Jr. left open the possibility the District could obtain a stay pending appeal of his previous ruling, which called the city's requirement that gun owners demonstrate a "good reason" to obtain a permit unconstitutional. He set a hearing on the matter for July 7.

In the meantime, the ruling means the Metropolitan Police Department may end up issuing concealed-carry permits to applicants who previously were denied because they could not demonstrate they faced a specific threat of injury or harm.

To comply with the ruling, Chief Lanier said the department would not deny any permit applications based on the "good reason" requirement.

The police department had received 107 concealed carry applications as of May 9, including 52 from D.C. residents and 55 from non-residents. The department reported denying 42 applications and approving 26. The remainder were either withdrawn or pending.
