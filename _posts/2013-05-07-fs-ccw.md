It's too bad Front Sight can't dovetail this class better with the Sheriff's department, to make it easier for course attendees to complete the Nevada portion of the CCW process. The people who process applications for the Sheriff's department can only handle a relatively few applicants in the afternoon between the end of the class at Front Sight and when they close the office for the evening. Lots of Front Sight CCW graduates arrived too late to be processed that afternoon, which means either they have to stay over until the next day, come back later, or forego applying for the permit. A Sheriff's department "CCW-processing sub-station" at Front Sight (with some way of obtaining a money order) would seem to be a tremendous boon to class graduates.
