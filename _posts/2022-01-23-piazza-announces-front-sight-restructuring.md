Dr. Piazza, creator, owner, and figurehead of the Front Sight firearms training facility in Pahrump, NV, today announced a 'restructuring' of fees for members and course attendees. Piazza claims that these changes, which vitiate all existing memberships and representations he previously made about Front Sight memberships and training, are necessary because members haven't been paying their fair share, and because a lender is attempting to foreclose due to non-payment of a loan. Piazza claims that Front Sight has never missed a payment, and that the lender is a "con man."

For years, the shooting community has been split between those who support Front Sight and those who believe that Piazza is himself a con man.
