As INTERPOL general secretary, Ronald Noble said in 2013 that the ways to battle terrorism in "soft target" areas, such as shopping malls or movie theaters, is to erect secure safety perimeters or allow the citizens to carry their own guns, an "armed citizenry."

In an October 21, 2013 with ABC News, Noble said that mass terror attacks make "police around the world question their views on gun control. It makes citizens question their views on gun control."

"You have to ask yourself, 'Is an armed citizenry more necessary now than it was in the past with an evolving threat of terrorism?'" he said. (Noble, an American, served as the general secretary of INTERPOL --- International Criminal Police Organization --- from 2000 to 2014.)

Noble's comments came in response to a terrorist attack in September of that year in Nairobi, Kenya. Members of the al-Shabab terror group opened fire at the Westgate mall, leaving at least 67 people dead.

According to Noble, there are only two ways to protect open societies from terror attacks like this one.

"One is to say we want an armed citizenry."

Noble also criticized the logic of gun control.

"People are quick to say 'gun control, people shouldn't be armed,' etc., etc. I think they have to ask themselves: 'Where would you have wanted to be? In a city where there was gun control and no citizens armed if you're in a Westgate mall, or in a place like Denver or Texas?'"

Several months ago, in May 2016, Noble released a video entitled, "Armed citizens help to stop terrorist massacres like Nairobi and Paris" that further clarified his views on allowing citizens to be armed.

"Not even the most heavily armed and well-trained police forces can be everywhere all the time, yet armed law-abiding citizens can protect and save lives until the police arrive."

"If my family or loved ones were being attacked by bloodthirsty terrorists like those in Kenya or Paris, then I would want armed citizens to defend and protect them."

"What would you want for your family and loved ones?" the video asks the audience.

Prior to his work at INTERPOL, Noble worked for the U.S. Treasury Department during the Clinton administration and the Department of Justice during the Reagan Administration.
