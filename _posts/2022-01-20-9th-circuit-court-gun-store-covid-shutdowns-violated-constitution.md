The Ninth Circuit federal appeals court ruled Thursday that the coronavirus lockdowns of gun stores in Ventura County, California, violated constitutional rights.

The case, *McDougall v. County of Ventura,* was appealed to the Ninth Circuit after the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California rejected a claim that Ventura County's coronavirus orders closing gun stores, ammo shops, and gun ranges violated Second Amendment rights.

Judges Lawrence Vandyke and Andrew Kleinfeld on the three-judge panel reversed the lower court.

Vandyke and Kleinfeld observed:

> Ultimately, the issue boils down to the County's designation of "essential" versus "non-essential" businesses and activities. While courts should afford some measure of deference to local policy determinations, "the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table." [Heller, 554 U.S.]({% post_url 2008-06-06-syllabus-in-district-of-columbia-et-al-v-heller %}) at 636. When a government completely bans all acquisition of firearms and ammunition by closing gun shops, ammunition shops, and firing ranges, it's one of those off-limits policy choices squarely contemplated by Heller. See id. at 630. The Orders cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.

Vandyke and Kleinfeld also noted, "Not only did Appellees fail to provide any evidence or explanation suggesting that gun shops, ammunition shops, and firing ranges posed a greater risk of spreading COVID19 than other businesses and activities deemed 'essential,' but they also failed to provide any evidence that they considered less restrictive alternatives for the general public."

Judge Ryan Nelson was the panel's dissenting voice.

The case is *McDougall v. County of Ventura,* No. 20-56220 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
