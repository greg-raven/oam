If you have a concealed carry permit and live in another state, Ohio now welcomes you.

It is now officially a law that you may bring your concealed carry into Ohio if you reside in another state.

Here's the official wordage, straight from the Ohio General Assembly Archives:

> Provides that if a person who is not an Ohio resident and has a valid concealed handgun license from another state, regardless of whether the other state has entered into a reciprocity agreement with the Attorney General, and the person is temporarily in Ohio, that out-of-state license will be recognized in Ohio during the time that the person is temporarily in Ohio (R.C. 109.69(B)(3)).

This essentially means Ohio now welcomes the lawful concealed carry of visitors. "This is a very comprehensive bill," said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association, to the Columbus Dispatch. "Over time, people will look back and see this as a watershed law that fixed a lot of little things."
