Earlier today, Calguns Foundation attorneys presented arguments on two important civil rights before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both cases have been brought against A.G. Kamala Harris and the State of California.

Tracy Rifle and Pistol v. Harris challenges California's ban on some truthful, non misleading handgun-related speech by firearms dealers -- what we believe is a violation of First Amendment rights.

Silvester v. Harris is a Second Amendment challenge to California's 10-day waiting period. The District Court previously ruled in our favor following a 3-day bench trial.
