For those who do not understand the meaning of our Second Amendment rights, let us make it clear once and for all:

The Second Amendment does not apply to semi-auto rifles, nor does it apply to bolt-action rifles, pistols, revolvers, or even fully-automatic rifles. The Second Amendment restricts government. The technology of the firearm is irrelevant. The restrictions on government remain the same, regardless of the firearm. The Second Amendment was not written to grant permission for citizens to own and bear firearms. It forbids government interference in citizens' rights to firearms, period. 'The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'

This also applies to our other rights. They are not granted, they stipulate inherent rights that the government may not prohibit.
