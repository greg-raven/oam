Over 90% of public mass shooters commit their acts of violence in [Gun Free Zones](https://bit.ly/2bdpM2O). And while the national media frequently covers these tragic stories, they rarely cover the overwhelming number of examples where armed citizens use guns to protect themselves and others.

President Obama commissioned the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence in 2013, and Slate reported on the findings in its article, "[Rethinking Gun Control: Surprising findings from a comprehensive report on gun violence](https://slate.me/KtPvBo)." Slate revealed that, according to the CDC, "defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year." When one compares these figures to the 30,000 yearly U.S. gun deaths (most of which are via suicide), one sees that guns are used 16 to 100 times more often to save life than take life.

> "I don't want to *feel* safe, I want to *be* safe. I want to be able to protect myself, I want other people to be able to protect themselves, and going into a gun free zone is definitely not the way to protect anybody." --- Larry Pratt

> "There's a whole list of places where killers have actually targeted the places where people can't protect themselves." --- Erich Pratt

> "We're not going to make people safe by trying to restrict access to guns. Because bad guys, we have found, get access to guns no matter what. You'll impede it for the good guys, bad guys will \[still\] be armed." --- Larry Pratt

> "In places where the government makes it illegal or very difficult to own a firearm for protection. Those are typically the most dangerous places--like Baltimore, like Washington DC, like Chicago. That is where people typically are waiting for police; that's almost their only option and sadly, a lot of people pay the ultimate price." --- Erich Pratt
