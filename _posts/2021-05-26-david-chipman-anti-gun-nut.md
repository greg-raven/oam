Gun-control advocate David Chipman, President Joe Biden's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), was in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee today. Questions were limited to five minutes per senator, which was good call by Democrats.

Chipman has already walked back his position on *[District of Columbia v. Heller]({% post_url 2008-06-06-syllabus-in-district-of-columbia-et-al-v-heller %}),* conceding that the Second Amendment is an individual right (his employers at Giffords disagree). He's walked back his claim that helicopters were shot down at Waco with ".50-caliber Barretts." He's walked back his mockery of first-time gun owners. He's walked back his contention that the government should be arresting gun owners "before they commit crimes." He now says it was a mistake. It was also a mistake, he says, to claim that only criminals and gun lobbyists supported deregulating suppressors.

What he didn't change his mind on, however, was the banning and confiscation of AR-15s. Chipman, in fact, wants to extend the National Firearms Act (NFA) to cover "assault weapons" as it does fully automatic guns. After prevaricating about the definition of "assault weapon" --- the type of firearms, remember, he is already willing to ban --- Chipman finally offered an obscure ATF definition, which includes any semi-automatic rifle with a detachable magazine that holds ammunition above .22 caliber. That means a massive number of rifles, the vast majority of which would never be used in a crime.

It isn't scaremongering to say that if Chipman's ATF definition of "assault weapons" would fall under the NFA, there would be a ban on owning most semi-automatic rifles in the future, an effective retroactive ban, a national registry to keep track of it all, among many other restrictions and fees. Such a law would likely create tens of millions of criminals overnight. Chipman, of course, doesn't have the power to implement any of these changes. Thank God.
