Numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the FBI, show that Americans are roughly 159 times more likely to be struck by a car and killed than shot and killed in a mass shooting.

Breitbart News previously reported that FBI stats show a total of 418 deaths in mass shootings --- or "mass killings" --- from 2000 to 2013. This works out to an average of 29.8 deaths per year in mass shootings.

Yet for 2012 alone, the CDC reports there were "4,743 pedestrians" struck by cars and killed in the US. That is over 159 times higher than the 29.8 annual average for mass shootings.

And NHTSA numbers from 2002 to 2011 are similar. The NHTSA reports that there were 45,943 persons struck by cars and killed between 2002 and 2011.

That is not a typo --- there were 45,943 pedestrian deaths.

In 2005 alone there were 4,892 pedestrians killed, which means you were over 164 times more likely to die by car while walking than in a mass shooting in that year. The year 2009 was the best for pedestrians --- only 4,109 were struck by cars and killed. However, even at that rate you were nearly 138 times more likely to be struck by a car and killed than shot and killed in a mass shooting.
