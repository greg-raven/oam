According to Vigilant Holsters, an Ohio-based maker of Kydex, leather, and hybrid holsters, the Sanford, Florida, Police Department's recent publication of a "gun buyback" event has been censored as a violation of Facebook's "community standards." The alleged violation? Describing "the purchase or sale of drugs, guns, or regulated products."

California gun owners will no doubt find humor here. It is no secret that Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies have nothing but contempt and disdain for the gun culture, so much so that they are working overtime to automatically remove pro-gun content because it doesn't conform to their agenda or "PC" culture. In any event, it's nice to see anti-Second Amendment companies trip over their own agenda.
