Gaston Glock, the Austrian engineer who founded Glock Ges.m.b.H in 1963 --- the company that ultimately took polymer-frame pistols mainstream for self-defense, law enforcement and military personnel --- died on Dec. 27, 2023. He was 94 years old.

When Glock first established his company, it specialized in non-firearm-related injection-molded products, including curtain rods and other small household items. It later landed contracts to make knives, machine-gun links and other gear for the Austrian military.

The company did well for the next two decades, but by the early 1980s Glock had come to understand the strength of modern, nylon-reinforced polymer when employed in a solidly engineered design. Perhaps it was fate, but the Austrian military was looking for a new standard-issue sidearm at about the same time.

Glock and his team designed a semiautomatic, 9 mm-chambered pistol to submit for consideration. That historic, polymer-frame Glock G17 was introduced in 1982. It --- the company's first handgun --- had a 17-round capacity, no manual safety and inventory of only 36 parts. It quickly gained a reputation for reliability in challenging conditions with minimal maintenance.

Those virtues showed, and the Austrian military adopted it in 1983. The next year it passed NATO durability testing, and shortly after, the Norwegian Army fielded it. The performance didn't escape the notice of other militaries and law enforcement departments, and orders grew.

The company expanded quickly afterward and opened an office in Smyrna, GA, in 1986. The next year a second factory began operation in Austria. The company's pistols continue to be among the most popular around the globe, both among professionals and civilians.
