"Those are dealer record of sales. Now you can have multiple long guns on one DROS. So you can have 5 long guns on one DROS. So, even though that number says one that could mean five guns so, it's not a true accurate number," said Gene Thome, owner of Bear Mountain Sports.

On an average day in California, anywhere between 1,200 and 1,500 guns are sold. Some buy for protection and many others dealers say purchase guns for gaming purposes.

More restrictions, changes and fees are coming January 1st and dealers say people will start coming in during the holidays to avoid all those extra hurdles.
