When things get ugly, no one is coming in time to help. You are responsible for your own safety and security. Our Forefathers knew this all too well, and they knew the critical role of self-defense in the face of civil unrest or societal collapse. So, they built protections of those natural rights into the Constitution.

Street violence in uncertain times is when the foundations of our liberties are tested, and when we must stand fast in our resolve to protect the Constitution and those we love.

But natural right to self-defense is not a privilege granted by politicians or governments. Self-defense and self-reliance are fundamental, natural rights that are also enshrined in our Constitution. But even so, they aren't automatic. These are rights we all must work to protect and preserve.
