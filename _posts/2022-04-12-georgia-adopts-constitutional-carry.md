And now there are 25!

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) today signed Constitutional Carry legislation into law, making it legal to carry a gun in public without a permit. The Peach State is the twenty-fifth state to abolish the need for carry permits.

"SB 319 makes sure that law abiding Georgians, including our daughters and your family too, can protect themselves without having to have permission from your state government," said Kemp.

The governor signed the Constitutional Carry Act into law Tuesday afternoon at a gun store in Douglasville.

Now, exactly half of the country has embraced Constitutional Carry, and the momentum isn't slowing down.

Four states have enacted Constitutional Carry laws this year. The first three were [Alabama]({% post_url 2022-03-03-alabama-becomes-22nd-constitutional-carry-state %}), [Ohio]({% post_url 2022-03-14-ohio-becomes-23rd-constitutional-carry-state %}), and [Indiana]({% post_url 2022-03-21-indiana-becomes-24th-constitutional-carry-state %}).

Florida also appears to be close to passing Constitutional Carry, potentially bringing the total number of states to twenty-six. Stay tuned!
