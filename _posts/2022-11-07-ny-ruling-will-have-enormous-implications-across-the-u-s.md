Today, Gun Owners of America (GOA) and Gun Owners Foundation (GOF) [secured a preliminary injunction in federal district court]({% post_url 2022-11-07-trump-appointee-blocks-ny-gun-law-says-dem-legislature-may-not-eviscerate-the-bill-of-rights %}) against most of New York's poorly named "Concealed Carry Improvement Act." This follows GOA and GOF securing a temporary restraining order against the law in October, which was frustratingly blocked by a federal appeals court.

The ruling from Judge Glenn Suddaby, who indicated this law has imposed "unprecedented constitutional violations," enjoins the following provisions:

- Requiring good moral character
- Requiring the names and contact info of spouses and other adults in the applicant's home
- Requiring applicants to disclose social media accounts for review
- The restrictions on carrying in public parks, zoos, places of worship, locations where alcohol is served, theaters, banquet halls, conferences, airports and buses, lawful protests or assemblies, and the prohibition on carrying on private property without express consent from the owner

The injunction will take effect immediately, despite the State of New York's attempt to delay the injunction.

Erich Pratt, GOA's Senior Vice President, issued the following statement:

> "Just like we warned politicians after the Bruen decision, fall in line, or we will force you to. We are excited to see Kathy Hochul finally served a plate of humble pie, and we are fully prepared to continue the fight should she again attempt to disarm the citizens of her state at a time when her party's policies are only escalating the danger that everyday citizens face."

Sam Paredes, on behalf of the Board of Directors for the Gun Owners Foundation, added:

> "This is very exciting for the citizens of New York, as today liberty won and tyranny lost. GOF and our allies remain fully prepared to defend this ruling from the foolish appeals that the anti-gunners in Albany will inevitably bring."
