- Robust defense of Second Amendment rights reiterates the key point that no inanimate object commits a crime --- some people using one do

John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), as well as the Heritage Foundation, each recently published pro-gun rights ammo for activists --- respectively, a Wall Street Journal article (reprinted at the CPRC website) and an ebook.

The former pertains to the staggering amount of violence committed with guns in profoundly gun-controlled Mexico.

And Heritage released an ebook that provided "[stubborn facts]({% post_url 2018-03-14-here-are-8-stubborn-facts-on-gun-violence-in-america %})" about violence committed with guns in the U.S.

Lott of the CPRC drew a vivid lack of connectivity between gun control initiatives and people committing violence with firearms.

Writing about the record number of murders in Mexico, Lott explained that "for the first nine months of 2019, Mexico had 25,890 murders --- almost six times as many murders per 100,000 people as in the U.S. Does Mexico need stricter gun control?"

Lott said that legal guns in Mexico are "very expensive," and Mexicans cannot buy rifles more powerful than a .22 caliber. Because of the stringent permitting process, "Only 1 percent of Mexicans possess a license to own firearms."

Only those who qualify for an "extraordinary" permit, which "never seems to be issued," can legally transfer a gun to anyone.

A person can only sell a gun, in fact, to the government --- and then it's up to the government to sell it to another person, or not.

In a cautionary tale for Americans who support the Second Amendment, Lott explained that until 1971, Mexicans, like Americans, had a right to own firearms. That changed after Mexico amended its constitution, giving its federal government primacy over the people's right to keep and bear arms.

What promises do you think gun control advocates made during the run-up to that usurpation of liberty?

I'm sure it had something to do with assuring people they'd still be able to possess guns, but that the government would make possessing guns "safer." Well, now, even legal Mexican gun owners would be breaking the law if they stepped across their driveway to bring a gun next door to show it to a neighbor.

That's even if the gun is "lawfully registered, unloaded, in a locked container" --- and more.

Unless the gun owner gets a permit from the Secretariat of National Defense, that person cannot leave his or her house with a gun. If you think that could not happen here in the United States, just look at what many prominent Democrats and anti-gun rights groups are telling us about their plans for gun control.

[...]

The gun --- or the car --- doesn't kill people. And the person who doesn't use his or her gun --- or car --- to commit crimes doesn't kill people, either.

Instead, the anti-gun forces prey on the human instinct to want bad things to not have happened and wish things that will happen to never happen again. It's a natural but unrealistic and immature desire that must be tempered with reality.

Gun grabbers also say they believe it is somehow possible to disarm everyone, even criminals.

So, they pass more and more onerous laws that cause increased hassles and expense for law-abiding gun owners --- who, like law-abiding drivers, are not the problem.
