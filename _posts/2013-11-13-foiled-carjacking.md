Tariq Bell and his 13-year-old daughter had just left a music store when they were approached by a 40-year-old stranger.

The man had just robbed someone at a nearby hotel and was being pursued by police. The fugitive grabbed Bell from behind, jumped into the driver's seat of his vehicle and demanded the keys. With his daughter already in the backseat of the vehicle, Bell acted quickly. He drew his firearm and ordered the man to get out of his vehicle. When the fugitive saw Bell's gun, he fled. It was reported that he then tried to carjack another victim who sped away. He was, however, successful in carjacking a third victim and led police on a high speed chase. He was ultimately apprehended and faces charges including armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping and aggravated assault on a police officer. Neither Bell nor his daughter was injured during the incident.
