In the recall election to oust Gavin Newsom, a real contender has emerged to become the next Governor of California: Larry Elder.

Larry is a nationally syndicated radio host and newspaper columnist, bestselling author, award-winning documentary filmmaker, and one of the best-known media figures in America today. His flagship daily radio program, "The Larry Elder Show," is heard every weekday in all 50 states, on more than 300 stations.

Elder has a B.A. in Political Science from Brown University, and a J.D. from the University of Michigan School of Law.

Larry also is a member of Front Sight. He needs our support.

Elder says: "I'm running for governor because the decline of California isn't the fault of its people. Our government is what's ruining the Golden State. Our schools are closed to both students and their parents. Our streets aren't safe from rising violent crime or the disaster of rising homelessness. And the scandals of Sacramento aren't going to stop on their own. It's time to tell the truth. We've got a state to save."
