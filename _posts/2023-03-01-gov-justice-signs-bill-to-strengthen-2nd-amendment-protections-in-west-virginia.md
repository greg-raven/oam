CHARLESTON, WV --- Gov. Jim Justice held a signing ceremony today for Senate Bill 10, the Campus Self-Defense Act. This bill allows law-abiding West Virginians, who already have a concealed carry permit, to carry concealed on the campus of a state institution of higher education beginning July 1, 2024.

"I'm proud to sign the Campus Self-Defense Act which will strengthen 2nd Amendment protections in West Virginia," Gov. Justice said. "West Virginia now joins 11 other U.S. states, including Texas and Utah, that have had this legislation for years. I've always said I will do everything I can to protect West Virginia's 2nd Amendment rights, and with this law, West Virginia will continue to be a national leader. I sincerely thank the Legislature for passing this bill overwhelmingly and the National Rifle Association for their support."
