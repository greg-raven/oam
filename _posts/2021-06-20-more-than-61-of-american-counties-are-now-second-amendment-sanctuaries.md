There are now 1,930 counties that are protected by Second Amendment Sanctuary legislation at either the state or county level. This represents 61.39% of all of the counties in the United States of America. Strangely, as was recently pointed out by Lee Williams, The Gun Writer, the media seems to be ignoring this movement still, for the most part. We have seen plenty of news about Constitutional Carry, which is another movement that we are actually quite supportive of. Yet the mainstream news has remained relatively silent regarding the massive Second Amendment Sanctuary movement, which leads us to a few questions.

**State versus Local**

Texas brought us up to 21 states that have enacted Constitutional Carry laws, but how many Constitutional Carry Counties do you know of? What was the last Constitutional Carry City you read about? Townships? Boroughs? Again, we are very supportive of Constitutional Carry, but one of the differences between it and the Second Amendment Sanctuary movement is that Constitutional Carry is being passed at the state level, while approximately 1,137 counties have taken it upon themselves to pass Second Amendment Sanctuary legislation and likely hundreds of cities, townships, boroughs, etc have done so at their level as well. The Second Amendment Sanctuary movement is a grassroots / bottom-up movement.

Recently, individuals like Dan Bongino and Glenn Beck have been telling us to get involved in local politics. Steve Deace changed the theme of his show to, "The answer is us," indicating that we as individuals need to start taking action locally at our school boards and city / county governments. So, it is rather unfortunate to see that we're already doing what they have been calling for, but nobody is paying attention.

**Don't get complacent**

If you live in a state that has passed Second Amendment Sanctuary State legislation, but your county has not done so locally, you should consider taking steps to pass your own 2A Sanctuary resolution or ordinance. If you would like some info about how to get started, please read our article, How to become a Sanctuary County. If you would like to see some examples of resolutions / ordinances that have been passed in other counties, please visit our Resolutions page. If you have any questions about how this process works, please feel free to email us at contact@sanctuarycounties.com.

We tell people to go ahead and get something passed at the local level because you never know how quickly your state can be turned against you. Just ask any Virginia gun owner how quickly your state can change from pro-gun to anti-gun. Don't wait until it happens in your state to get started. Also, getting this process started in your county or city is a great way to get your fellow Second Amendment Supporters involved in local government. If you get them to sign a petition for 2A Sanctuary, make sure to get their email addresses as well so you can potentially follow up with them to support other Sanctuary legislation like COVID-19 Sanctuary, Vaccine Passport Sanctuary, Vaccine Mandate Sanctuary, or even a Sanctuary for the Unborn.

**National Map update**

The featured image for this article is the National Second Amendment Sanctuary Counties Map for June 18, 2021. This is a lower resolution map. We like to keep our higher resolution maps stored elsewhere so that they don't slow down the website. A link to the higher resolution map is listed below. Be aware that there are likely more counties that have passed Second Amendment Sanctuary resolutions / ordinances than are represented on this map. If yours has passed a resolution or ordinance and does not appear on this map, please send an email to contact@sanctuarycounties.com. If possible, please include a copy of the signed resolution / ordinance as well as the date and vote count for that resolution / ordinance.
