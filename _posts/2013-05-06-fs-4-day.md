This visit to Front Sight was much better than [my previous visit](https://www.heeled.website/reviews/20110920-front-sight-2-day/index.php), because this time I arrived with a better mind-set. My mindset prior to my first visit to Front Sight was colored by a combat hand-gunning class from Chuck Taylor's American Small Arms Academy many years before. Taylor was a bit of a demi-god back then --- a guy who tested the efficacy of bullet-proof vests by putting them on and having someone shoot him in the chest from a few feet away. The stuff of legend, Taylor was rumored to have been in several actual gun fights, emerging the winner in each one. Back then, modern combat hand-gunning was more or less in its infancy, and as one of its most credible proponents, if Taylor said something, that was considered to be the way it was. Jeff Cooper was probably better known, but Taylor had street cred that couldn't be equalled.
