Gun Free Zones Claim 100+ Victims in Only 8 Attacks

Calls for more gun control almost always follow a public crime or terror attack in which the attacker --- or attackers --- use a gun. Yet many of the most infamous attacks take place in gun free zones --- places where law-abiding citizens disarm themselves to comply with the rules while criminals take advantage of disarmed masses and open fire.

What follows are just a few of the many examples of shootings in gun free zones that could be listed. There is not one type of firearm that can be blamed --- the weapon used was sometimes a handgun, sometimes a rifle, other times a shotgun --- nor is there one specific race that can be pinpointed --- the attackers come from various races/ethnicities. Nor is this a situation where expanding background checks would have made even the slightest difference --- all the attackers listed but one, Adam Lanza, passed a background check for their firearms. Lanza opted to steal his guns instead.

The common thread is that the attacks took place in areas where the gunman knew he could inflict damage at his own pace, without the threat of reprisal from armed citizens:

There you have it --- eight attacks over the last 8 years in which gunmen opened fire in places where citizens were disarmed by policies that treat law-abiding citizens and criminals alike. The result? 105 innocent lives taken and more than 150 others injured by gun fire in gun free zones.

The bottom line --- gun free zones are not gun free for criminals. Rather, they are soft targets that offer an invitation to attackers who do not want to face the possibility of would-be victims shooting back.
