Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey is taking a hard stance on the risk of terrorist attacks.

In a nearly 7-minute video posted to the official Sheriff's Office Facebook page, Ivey calls on all residents, law enforcement, military or otherwise, to be "mentally and physically ready to respond to an attack."

"Let there be no mistake in what I'm about to say, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," Ivey said in the viral video.

That statement is one that stirs controversy and divides those who favor stricter gun control laws over those who stand in staunch protection of Second Amendment rights.

However, response to the video on the Brevard Sheriff's Facebook page was overwhelmingly positive. Comment after comment praises Ivey for "telling it like it is" and having the guts to stand up for safety.

Some commenters even wrote that the video persuaded them to obtain a concealed carry permit in order to defend against potential threats.

At the end of the video, Ivey encourages those who already have permits and those who wish to acquire one to attend a once-monthly tactical shooting course where gun owners can learn shooting skills as well as the ins and outs of Florida laws such as Stand your Ground and self-defense.

"If you're a person who is legally licensed to carry a firearm, now is the time more than ever to realize that you and you alone may very well be the first line of defense for you, your family," Ivey said.

Ivey called shootings like those last week in San Bernardino, California, attacks "by armed, evil people." He suggested that an armed citizen might be the one able to "defend and survive ... until the cavalry can arrive."

Ivey assured in his video that his statements were not meant to encourage vigilante action.

"What I am saying is that we need to be mentally and physically ready to respond," Ivey said.

He also called on elected officials and law enforcement officials nationwide to stop worrying so much about being politically correct.

"It's time for PC to become the acronym for protecting citizens," Ivey said. He add that it's time for "America to get back to being American."

And he encouraged the media to stop giving airtime to terrorists looking for their 15 minutes of fame.

"Together we can make a difference," Ivey said. "One good person at the right place and the right time will make the difference."
