On Wednesday, Gov. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) declared Nebraska a "2nd Amendment Sanctuary State."

The state-level action comes after passage of "Second Amendment Sanctuary" status in a number of Nebraska counties, WOWT noted.

NTV ABC highlighted the proclamation's warning: "The White House and U.S. Congress have announced their intention to pursue measures that would infringe on the right to keep and bear arms," it reads. As a result, "Nebraska will stand up against federal overreach and attempts to regulate gun ownership and use in the Good Life."

Ricketts posted a video himself signing the proclamation to Facebook.

On April 7, 2021, Breitbart News reported Gov. Doug Ducey (R-AZ) signed legislation prohibiting the in-state enforcement of federal gun control laws that infringe on the Second Amendment.

The Associated Press observed the legislation Ducey signed, HB 2111, "[prohibits] police and sheriffs from enforcing federal gun laws that violate the 2nd Amendment."
