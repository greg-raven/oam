Detroit residents are increasingly carrying guns for self-defense, and Detroit Police Chief James Craig describes an armed citizenry as part of what has been successful in fighting crime in the city.

In fact, Craig suggests other cities should take note and learn the benefit of residents who take the time to get a concealed carry license and who carry a gun to protect life and property.

In January 2014 and again in March 2014, Craig spoke to the benefits he thought Detroit would gain by more residents being armed, and he made clear that he supports law-abiding residents using guns to fight back when criminals attack. According to Political Vel Craft he said, "The message should be that, you know, people are going to protect themselves. They're tired, they've been dealing with this epidemic of violence, they're afraid and they have a right to protect themselves."

And now --- a year and a half later --- Fox News reports more and more Detroit residents are getting their carry permits and Craig likes what he sees. He said, "When you look at the city of Detroit, we're kind of leading the way in terms of urban areas with law-abiding citizens carrying guns."

Firearm Instructor Rick Ector spoke to the surge he has seen in attendance at his training courses, referring to it as the "Chief Craig effect." He said, "Home invasions have gone down. A huge reason was that there was a huge spate of homeowners using their guns against intruders. More people have guns and it's making burglars cautious."

Ector made clear that the renewed interest in concealed carry has not not been simply for men. He said, "It used to be that we would only have one or two women in a class," he said. "Now we are seeing much, much more. This past May, I held a class where we trained 300 ladies."
