    criminals don&rsquo;t know who is armed.

    History has shown us that armed law-abiding citizens can often stop
    <a href="/category/situations/">bad situations</a> from getting worse.
</p>
<p>
    Only by taking responsibility for your own safety, and getting training that
    will give you the edge you need to guarantee that safety, will you be able
    to thrive, survive, and get out alive in bad situations.

    I urge you to find out what your state requires to allow you to carry a
    weapon (preferably concealed) legally, and fulfill your obligations as a
    citizen.

        <q>The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and
        wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United
        States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and
        court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that
        what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and
        carry firearms in a peaceful manner.</q>

    <p>
        <q>The right of a citizen to bear arms, in lawful defense of himself or
        the State, is absolute. He does not derive it from the State government.
        It is one of the high powers delegated directly to the citizen, and is
        excepted out of the general powers of government. A law cannot be passed
        to infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and
        independent of the lawmaking power.</q>

        <q>The maintenance of the right to bear arms is a most essential one to
