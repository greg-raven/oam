<p>
	These sites are dedicated to the proposition that society is safer when criminals don't know who is armed.
</p>
<p>
	History has shown us that armed law-abiding citizens can often stop <a href="/category/situations/">bad situations</a> from getting worse.
</p>
<p>
	Only by taking responsibility for your own safety, and getting training that will give you the edge you need to guarantee that safety, will you be able to thrive, survive, and get out alive in bad situations.

	I urge you to find out what your state requires to allow you to carry a weapon (preferably concealed) legally, and fulfill your obligations as a citizen.

		"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."

		"The right of a citizen to bear arms, in lawful defense of himself or the State, is absolute. He does not derive it from the State government. It is one of the high powers delegated directly to the citizen, and is excepted out of the general powers of government. A law cannot be passed to infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and independent of the lawmaking power."
